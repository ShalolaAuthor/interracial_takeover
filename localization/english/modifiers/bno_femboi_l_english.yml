bno_lap_pet: "Bull’s Lap Pet"
bno_lap_pet_desc: "Always purring in a Bull’s lap, hips swaying, shift hitched high, eager for every grope and command. The camp’s favorite sissy trophy—petted, teased, and shown off by Bulls who love to make him moan and beg in the firelight, soft and obedient for every filthy touch."
