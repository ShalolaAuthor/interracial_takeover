bno_femboi.0001.title: "First Hunger"
bno_femboi.0001.desc: "I can’t eat. I push the bread around my plate, swallow a little broth, but it’s all tasteless, useless. My belly growls, but it isn’t for food—it’s for something else. Ever since I tasted that Elixir, my tongue can’t forget the thick sweetness. I keep thinking about him—the Bull I saw by the stable, his skin so dark it makes my breath catch, the weight of his cock showing through his tunic, the way he looked right at me, like he knew what I’d become.\n\nI haven’t changed. I look down at myself: just a flat chest, plain hips, my cock hanging soft and sad. When I touch myself, it barely twitches. I remember when I used to jerk off and it felt good, but now I just feel empty, raw, like my hand isn’t enough. My fingers drift between my legs, down to my ass, and I wonder—would it feel different if I pushed inside? Would it make me feel full, like I’m supposed to be?\n\nThe worst part is the hunger. It doesn’t fade, not even after I guzzle down milk and try to pretend it’s something hotter, thicker, something that would leave my lips sticky and my belly warm. I stand by the window, licking the last white drops from my mouth, wishing it were his, wishing he’d use me, fill me up. I press my thighs together and shudder, my skin hot, my thoughts filthy, every inch of me desperate to be noticed, used, remade.\n\nI know nothing has changed on the outside. But inside, I’m falling apart. I can’t stop thinking about being on my knees, begging for cock, drinking every drop, letting myself be ruined. I ache, I tremble, and no matter how I try to fight it, the hunger just grows."

bno_femboi.0002.title: "Mirror Confession"
bno_femboi.0002.desc: "Candlelight flickers on the battered tin mirror, throwing my reflection into sharp relief—cheeks flushed, lips parted, hair falling soft around my jaw. I freeze, drawn by my own gaze, heart pounding, cock already drooling against my thigh. My fingers come up, hesitant, brushing over lips that look pinker than I ever remember, tracing the slope of my cheek and down to my neck. I bite my lower lip, watch myself shiver, and can’t stop staring at how needy, how wet, how fuckable I look. Is that really me?\n\nI step closer, breath misting the glass, thighs pressing tight as the heat builds low and sweet, swirling under my belly. My skin feels electric—every inch too sensitive, tingling where candlelight kisses it, nipples pebbling under my thin shirt, a whimper slipping out just from the idea of being watched, caught, wanted. I pout, on purpose, watching my lips glisten. I flutter my lashes, head tilting to the side, hips rolling in a slow, helpless sway as I imagine a strong hand grabbing my hair, pinning me against the wall, making me beg.\n\nMy cock twitches, so small, so useless, leaking clear grool as I drag my palm over the front of my trousers, teasing myself through the fabric, moaning for my own reflection. I imagine someone walking in—catching me like this, hungry and soft, practicing a slutty, breathless giggle just for them. My voice trembles, half-whisper, half-moan: “Please, just call me pretty… tell me I’m yours. Tell me I’m made to be used.”\n\nI arch my back, jutting my ass, hips cocked, swaying like a little whore. I press my fingertips to my lips, then to the glass, tracing the outline of my mouth and moaning as I watch the fog bloom under my touch. Every second at the mirror makes it harder to deny how much I crave this—how badly I want to give in, let myself become soft, pretty, helpless, dripping for cock and praise and filthy, filthy attention.\n\nBut a spark of fear coils in my chest. Am I really going to let myself become this? I stare myself down, chest heaving, teeth biting hard at my lip, fighting not to run or break down or beg for more."

bno_femboi.1002.title.1: "Practice Makes Perfect"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.1: "I can’t stop myself. My body moves on its own—hips swaying, back arching, cock leaking all over my thigh—as I stare into the mirror, tongue sliding out to wet lips that look glossier and pinker every day. I tease my mouth, pout and bat my lashes, dragging my hand through my hair the way the blacked sluts do in the market when they want the Bulls and the refugees to notice, to grab, to use.\n\nA giggle bubbles up—soft at first, then high and whorish, desperate for attention. My nipples strain against my shirt, hard and aching, just begging to be pinched, twisted, stretched by hands twice as big as mine. I keep glancing at the door, breath hitching, whole body tingling at the thought of one of those Black Bulls or cock-hungry refugees barging in, seeing me like this: a blushing, giggling femboy, putting on a show just for their hungry eyes.\n\nMy hand drops to my cock, just a sticky little nub now, oozing grool for them. I hump the table, ass grinding and rolling, moaning “mmm, ahhh, please—look at me, make me yours, fuck me, show me what a pretty little sissy hole is for.” I twist my hair around my finger, batting my lashes, giggling louder, picturing those massive, dark cocks pushing between my cheeks, pinning me to the table, stretching my ass wider and wider until I can’t do anything but squeal and beg for more.\n\nThe air is thick with the scent of sweat, cum, and the memory of the breeding barn—where blacked sluts giggle, gape, and moan as Bulls and refugees take them in every hole, where pale skin is just a canvas for handprints and seed, where even the giggles echo with the sound of balls slapping and holes being ruined. My voice trembles as I try to copy it: “Breed me, please, make me your cumdump, your little whore, your blacked femboy—let the whole camp see me dripping, moaning, begging for cock and never, ever being satisfied.”\n\nI imagine them lined up behind me—Bulls grinning, refugees stroking their heavy cocks, ready to break me, fill me, paint my insides with their seed until it leaks from my pussy, my ass, my mouth, until every inch of my skin is slick, darkening, owned. I want to be used, fucked, left ruined and empty, my giggle turning to a sob, my body only good for milking cock and swallowing load after endless load.\n\nI keep teasing and grinding, grinding and giggling, my eyes glazed, drool on my lips, shivering as the heat and humiliation soak through me. I want them to see. I want them to laugh. I want to be the camp’s sissy slut, always bent, always open, always dripping for BBC and every filthy refugee with a cock big enough to split me. I want to be nothing but a giggling, cock-hungry spectacle—bred, broken, blacked forever."
bno_femboi.1002.a.1: "Grind, giggle, and beg to be bred and owned."

bno_femboi.1002.title.2: "Pretty for Them"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.2: "I lean closer, breath fogging the mirror as I pout, lips plush and slick, cheeks burning with shame and pride all tangled together. My lashes flutter, my voice comes out high and sweet, almost trembling as I whisper it: “I’m pretty…” My own reflection sends a shiver right through me, cock dribbling grool onto the floor as I mouth the words over and over—practicing for the Bulls, the refugees, for anyone who might see and take me.\n\nMy hips start to sway on their own, little circles, ass popping with every shift. My hands slide up to cup my cheeks, pressing them together, making my face look even softer, more desperate to be marked, to be used. “Please,” I whisper, “just use me, make me your little pretty bitch, your fucktoy, your blacked femboy…” The thought alone has my cock twitching, oozing helplessly, while my chest tingles, nipples aching and raw under my shirt, begging for rough hands—big, Black hands—to stretch me wider, paint me darker, make me their own.\n\nI close my eyes and let the fantasy run wild: dark hands curling in my hair, forcing me to keep looking at myself, to watch my mouth stretch around a cock so big it leaves me sobbing and drooling, gagging for more. I picture myself bent over in front of the mirror, watching my own ruined, blushing face as the biggest Bull in camp splits my ass, the slap of his balls against my cheeks ringing in my ears while I moan, squeal, beg to be filled, to be marked, to be bred.\n\nThe air is thick with the memory of sweat and seed—like the breeding tent, where the prettiest sluts are lined up and turned out for every Bull and every desperate black refugee, all of them wanting a piece of soft, pretty, moaning meat. I hear the echoes in my head, the laughter, the jeers, the wet slap of cock in hole, the deep, rumbling voices calling me “pretty bitch,” “seed sponge,” “my little sissy cumdump,” until my head spins and my body aches to make it real.\n\nI open my eyes, lips swollen, voice breaking, still whispering “I’m pretty, I’m pretty, please, please, fuck me, fill me, let me show you how soft and needy I can be—make me your favorite slut, your prettiest little thing, let everyone see what I am…” My hands slide lower, grinding against my cock, making it drool even more, hips rolling in little circles as I lose myself in the vision—begging, hoping, desperate to be seen, to be ruined, to be owned."

bno_femboi.1002.title.3: "Ugly Denial"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.3: "I clench my jaw, nails digging into my palms as I glare at my own reflection, fighting down every filthy urge boiling under my skin. My lips are trembling, my cheeks still flushed, cock still drooling, but I force myself to scowl, to straighten my back, to look away from the mirror and pretend I don’t see the softness, the hunger, the desperate, ruined little sissy hiding in my eyes. I spit a bitter curse, shove away from the table, and march out, thighs rubbing, body screaming for touch, for praise, for cock—but I choke it all down, lock it all away, pretending I’m still strong, still a man.\n\nEvery step away from the mirror is agony. Shame crawls under my skin, burning hotter than any touch. The memory of how I almost gave in—how close I was to pouting, giggling, begging to be called pretty—haunts every breath. I grind my teeth, fists clenched, willing myself to forget, to fight, to survive another day without surrendering. But the ache lingers, hollow and sharp, and I know I’ll only want it more tomorrow."
bno_femboi.1002.a.3: "Keep my head down and suffer in silence, trembling with shame"

bno_femboi.0003.title: "Strange Sensations at Night"
bno_femboi.0003.desc: "Night presses heavy, thick with the musk of breeding and sweat that never quite fades from the camp. I lie twisted in the dark, sheets damp with my own need, cock shrunk to a slick, useless nub against my thigh, drooling grool into the hollow of my leg. Every sound seems sharper after lights-out—echoes of moans and the deep, grunting thrusts of Bulls fucking their sluts in the open tents, Black seed flooding every pussy, every hole, every belly but mine.\n\nI press my thighs together, heat pooling low and deep, my hips tingling in a way I never felt before. Every inch of me is awake, restless, skin prickling where the air brushes over it, nipples hard and throbbing under my shirt. I grind against the mattress, shame twisting in my gut because I know it’s not enough—I’m hungry, empty, desperate, every nerve in my ass and belly screaming for more than the shallow friction I can get alone.\n\nI remember the Bull that watched me earlier, his cock so thick I could see it swinging beneath his rags, his laugh booming as he bragged about breeding another white slut until she couldn’t walk straight. I remember how his gaze lingered on my hips, how every word made me ache, wishing I could be the one drooling, gaping, filled for the whole camp to see.\n\nNow the hunger is worse. The ache is everywhere, stronger than fear or shame. My cock is softer, smaller, wetter—my ass tingles with every breath, my thoughts are filthier, wild with the need to be filled, bred, made into something new. I lie there panting, heart pounding, torn between squeezing my legs together and pushing them wide, afraid someone will hear the way I whimper, the way I gasp and grind and beg inside my head.\n\nThe urge to touch, to push deeper, to find relief—it's growing stronger, almost impossible to ignore. But for a moment, all I do is squirm in the dark, trapped by the hunger, helpless and waiting at the edge."

bno_femboi.1003.title.1: "Empty and Wanting"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.1: "The ache won’t fade—it just coils tighter with every breath, making my whole body tremble beneath the thin sheets. My thighs spread, knees falling open as I let my hand slip down, breath shuddering, every fingertip trailing slick across my belly and down between my legs. My cock is barely more than a nub now, drooling helplessly, almost numb except for the ache it leaves behind. My hips roll slow, desperate, chasing the friction that never really satisfies. It isn’t enough—I need something deeper, something filthier, something that might make the gnawing hunger finally, finally stop.\n\nI press my fingers lower, dipping between my cheeks, ass clenching as I find my hole, slick with grool and sweat. The touch makes me whimper, hips jerking, back arching off the mattress. I bite my lip to muffle a moan, but it slips out anyway, high and needy, the kind of sound the Bulls laugh at when they pass by the tents at night. I imagine one of them standing over me now, cock thick and veined, shadow swallowing my trembling body as he watches me fuck myself, desperate to be filled, to be bred, to be owned.\n\nI push my fingers inside, slow at first, savoring the stretch, the heat, the filthy slickness that makes me feel like I’m already fucked. My hole clenches around my own hand, hungry for something bigger, darker, rougher—something that will leave me drooling, leaking, unable to close my legs for days. I rock my hips, grinding my ass down against my palm, fucking myself harder as the pleasure builds, mouth open and wet, moaning into the night like a slut on display.\n\nEvery thrust makes me shake, sweat dripping down my sides, nipples aching, cock leaking more grool with every filthy thought that flashes through my mind. I see myself bent over in the breeding barn, blacked sluts and refugee bitches watching as Bulls line up behind me, laughing at how empty and desperate I am, how easy it is to make a white sissy beg. My body trembles, back arching as I moan for more, begging the darkness, the Bulls, anyone who might hear—“please, please, fill me, breed me, make me yours, make me pretty, make me open forever.”\n\nThe mattress creaks beneath me, sheets soaked, skin tingling as the heat builds, sharp and dizzying, burning through me until I’m grinding, gasping, every muscle locked as I fuck myself deeper, faster, chasing the fantasy of being split open by a Bull’s cock, of being filled with seed until it leaks from my hole and pools on the sheets, proof for everyone to see that I’m nothing but a blacked, owned, begging slut.\n\nWhen it’s over, I collapse, panting, fingers still buried deep, hole clenching on nothing, the ache fading into a sweet, slow pulse. I stare at the ceiling, body sticky and trembling, still wishing it was a Bull, not my hand, that had left me empty and wanting, desperate for more."
bno_femboi.1003.a.1: "Lie there leaking, hips twitching, still begging the darkness to send a Bull to finally fill me"

bno_femboi.1003.title.2: "Quiet Desperation"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.2: "I squeeze my eyes shut, heart pounding as I slide my hand down, fingers shaking with the hunger that won’t fade. My cock is just a sad, leaking nub, slick with grool that stains my thigh, nowhere near hard, just twitching with each needy pulse. I rub slow, pressing my palm tight against the swollen head, grinding my hips into the mattress in tiny, desperate circles, every movement slick and sticky, every sound in the dark suddenly deafening.\n\nMy breath hitches, chest heaving, mouth pressed hard into the pillow to muffle the whimpers I can’t stop. I hear them—deep voices, the low, rumbling laughter of Bulls echoing from across the camp, the moans of sluts being bred in the tents, the slap of balls and the wet, helpless squeals of girls split wide for cock. The sounds flood my head, making the heat in my belly twist and flare, shame and arousal tangling until I’m dizzy with it, thighs slick, body tense and shaking.\n\nI can’t let anyone know—can’t let the Bulls or the blacked sluts or the caged whitebois hear how needy I am, how filthy, how close I am to crying for a taste, a touch, a single word of praise. I bite my lip hard, grinding my nub with frantic, trembling fingers, hips jerking, fighting back every moan, every gasp, every desperate plea that wants to spill out and echo through the darkness.\n\nBut it’s never enough. I rub faster, chasing the edge, feeling my whole body burn as I imagine strong hands pinning me down, a heavy, black cock pressing to my lips, my ass, my sissy hole, filling me, using me, making me squirm and squeal until I’m leaking and broken, begging for more. The thought alone makes me whimper into the pillow, cock dribbling more grool as I shake and twitch, desperate and unsatisfied.\n\nThe pleasure is sharp, short, burning away as quickly as it comes, leaving me sticky and aching, the hunger barely dulled. I curl up, breath shuddering, still listening to the sounds of fucking and moaning all around me, still wishing it was my turn, my hole, my voice crying out for more."

bno_femboi.1003.title.3: "Too Weak to Resist"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.3: "I clamp my thighs together, curling in on myself beneath the thin, sticky sheets. My face is buried deep in the pillow, breath coming in hot, broken sobs as the ache under my skin turns raw, scraping, unbearable. My cock is nothing—just a leaking nub, pulsing with every heartbeat, drooling slick against my trembling leg. My hips grind into the mattress, but I refuse to touch, refuse to give in, even as every inch of my body screams for relief.\n\nI can hear them—Bulls grunting and breeding sluts out in the night, the slap of balls, the filthy wet squelch of holes being ruined, the gasping, begging cries of bitches split and filled over and over. Each sound is a knife of shame and longing, twisting deeper every time another slut moans or a Bull laughs. My cheeks are slick with tears. I rock myself, grinding my face deeper into the pillow to stifle the ragged whimpers that keep slipping out.\n\nThe urge to open my legs, to reach down, to beg for the touch that would make the hunger fade is overwhelming. My skin tingles, nipples hard, ass clenching empty and desperate. I shake with need, sobbing into the darkness, cursing my own weakness. My body won’t let me sleep, won’t let me rest, won’t let me forget the heavy, stretching emptiness between my thighs.\n\nEvery minute feels like an hour. I keep my legs clenched tight, trying to keep the ache inside, but it’s no use—my whole body aches to be split, to be filled, to be made into the sissy whore the Bulls laugh about, the one who can’t resist, can’t stop crying, can’t stop begging. I press my face deeper, tears soaking the pillow, shame and need swirling until I’m nothing but a shaking mess, empty and waiting, too weak to resist, too proud to give in."
