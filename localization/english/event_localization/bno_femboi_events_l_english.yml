bno_femboi.0001.title: "First Hunger"
bno_femboi.0001.desc: "I can’t eat. I push the bread around my plate, swallow a little broth, but it’s all tasteless, useless. My belly growls, but it isn’t for food—it’s for something else. Ever since I tasted that Elixir, my tongue can’t forget the thick sweetness. I keep thinking about him—the Bull I saw by the stable, his skin so dark it makes my breath catch, the weight of his cock showing through his tunic, the way he looked right at me, like he knew what I’d become.\n\nI haven’t changed. I look down at myself: just a flat chest, plain hips, my cock hanging soft and sad. When I touch myself, it barely twitches. I remember when I used to jerk off and it felt good, but now I just feel empty, raw, like my hand isn’t enough. My fingers drift between my legs, down to my ass, and I wonder—would it feel different if I pushed inside? Would it make me feel full, like I’m supposed to be?\n\nThe worst part is the hunger. It doesn’t fade, not even after I guzzle down milk and try to pretend it’s something hotter, thicker, something that would leave my lips sticky and my belly warm. I stand by the window, licking the last white drops from my mouth, wishing it were his, wishing he’d use me, fill me up. I press my thighs together and shudder, my skin hot, my thoughts filthy, every inch of me desperate to be noticed, used, remade.\n\nI know nothing has changed on the outside. But inside, I’m falling apart. I can’t stop thinking about being on my knees, begging for cock, drinking every drop, letting myself be ruined. I ache, I tremble, and no matter how I try to fight it, the hunger just grows."

bno_femboi.0002.title: "Mirror Confession"
bno_femboi.0002.desc: "Candlelight flickers on the battered tin mirror, throwing my reflection into sharp relief—cheeks flushed, lips parted, hair falling soft around my jaw. I freeze, drawn by my own gaze, heart pounding, cock already drooling against my thigh. My fingers come up, hesitant, brushing over lips that look pinker than I ever remember, tracing the slope of my cheek and down to my neck. I bite my lower lip, watch myself shiver, and can’t stop staring at how needy, how wet, how fuckable I look. Is that really me?\n\nI step closer, breath misting the glass, thighs pressing tight as the heat builds low and sweet, swirling under my belly. My skin feels electric—every inch too sensitive, tingling where candlelight kisses it, nipples pebbling under my thin shirt, a whimper slipping out just from the idea of being watched, caught, wanted. I pout, on purpose, watching my lips glisten. I flutter my lashes, head tilting to the side, hips rolling in a slow, helpless sway as I imagine a strong hand grabbing my hair, pinning me against the wall, making me beg.\n\nMy cock twitches, so small, so useless, leaking clear grool as I drag my palm over the front of my trousers, teasing myself through the fabric, moaning for my own reflection. I imagine someone walking in—catching me like this, hungry and soft, practicing a slutty, breathless giggle just for them. My voice trembles, half-whisper, half-moan: “Please, just call me pretty… tell me I’m yours. Tell me I’m made to be used.”\n\nI arch my back, jutting my ass, hips cocked, swaying like a little whore. I press my fingertips to my lips, then to the glass, tracing the outline of my mouth and moaning as I watch the fog bloom under my touch. Every second at the mirror makes it harder to deny how much I crave this—how badly I want to give in, let myself become soft, pretty, helpless, dripping for cock and praise and filthy, filthy attention.\n\nBut a spark of fear coils in my chest. Am I really going to let myself become this? I stare myself down, chest heaving, teeth biting hard at my lip, fighting not to run or break down or beg for more."

bno_femboi.1002.title.1: "Practice Makes Perfect"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.1: "I can’t stop myself. My body moves on its own—hips swaying, back arching, cock leaking all over my thigh—as I stare into the mirror, tongue sliding out to wet lips that look glossier and pinker every day. I tease my mouth, pout and bat my lashes, dragging my hand through my hair the way the blacked sluts do in the market when they want the Bulls and the refugees to notice, to grab, to use.\n\nA giggle bubbles up—soft at first, then high and whorish, desperate for attention. My nipples strain against my shirt, hard and aching, just begging to be pinched, twisted, stretched by hands twice as big as mine. I keep glancing at the door, breath hitching, whole body tingling at the thought of one of those Black Bulls or cock-hungry refugees barging in, seeing me like this: a blushing, giggling femboy, putting on a show just for their hungry eyes.\n\nMy hand drops to my cock, just a sticky little nub now, oozing grool for them. I hump the table, ass grinding and rolling, moaning “mmm, ahhh, please—look at me, make me yours, fuck me, show me what a pretty little sissy hole is for.” I twist my hair around my finger, batting my lashes, giggling louder, picturing those massive, dark cocks pushing between my cheeks, pinning me to the table, stretching my ass wider and wider until I can’t do anything but squeal and beg for more.\n\nThe air is thick with the scent of sweat, cum, and the memory of the breeding barn—where blacked sluts giggle, gape, and moan as Bulls and refugees take them in every hole, where pale skin is just a canvas for handprints and seed, where even the giggles echo with the sound of balls slapping and holes being ruined. My voice trembles as I try to copy it: “Breed me, please, make me your cumdump, your little whore, your blacked femboy—let the whole camp see me dripping, moaning, begging for cock and never, ever being satisfied.”\n\nI imagine them lined up behind me—Bulls grinning, refugees stroking their heavy cocks, ready to break me, fill me, paint my insides with their seed until it leaks from my pussy, my ass, my mouth, until every inch of my skin is slick, darkening, owned. I want to be used, fucked, left ruined and empty, my giggle turning to a sob, my body only good for milking cock and swallowing load after endless load.\n\nI keep teasing and grinding, grinding and giggling, my eyes glazed, drool on my lips, shivering as the heat and humiliation soak through me. I want them to see. I want them to laugh. I want to be the camp’s sissy slut, always bent, always open, always dripping for BBC and every filthy refugee with a cock big enough to split me. I want to be nothing but a giggling, cock-hungry spectacle—bred, broken, blacked forever."

bno_femboi.1002.title.2: "Pretty for Them"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.2: "I lean closer, breath fogging the mirror as I pout, lips plush and slick, cheeks burning with shame and pride all tangled together. My lashes flutter, my voice comes out high and sweet, almost trembling as I whisper it: “I’m pretty…” My own reflection sends a shiver right through me, cock dribbling grool onto the floor as I mouth the words over and over—practicing for the Bulls, the refugees, for anyone who might see and take me.\n\nMy hips start to sway on their own, little circles, ass popping with every shift. My hands slide up to cup my cheeks, pressing them together, making my face look even softer, more desperate to be marked, to be used. “Please,” I whisper, “just use me, make me your little pretty bitch, your fucktoy, your blacked femboy…” The thought alone has my cock twitching, oozing helplessly, while my chest tingles, nipples aching and raw under my shirt, begging for rough hands—big, Black hands—to stretch me wider, paint me darker, make me their own.\n\nI close my eyes and let the fantasy run wild: dark hands curling in my hair, forcing me to keep looking at myself, to watch my mouth stretch around a cock so big it leaves me sobbing and drooling, gagging for more. I picture myself bent over in front of the mirror, watching my own ruined, blushing face as the biggest Bull in camp splits my ass, the slap of his balls against my cheeks ringing in my ears while I moan, squeal, beg to be filled, to be marked, to be bred.\n\nThe air is thick with the memory of sweat and seed—like the breeding tent, where the prettiest sluts are lined up and turned out for every Bull and every desperate black refugee, all of them wanting a piece of soft, pretty, moaning meat. I hear the echoes in my head, the laughter, the jeers, the wet slap of cock in hole, the deep, rumbling voices calling me “pretty bitch,” “seed sponge,” “my little sissy cumdump,” until my head spins and my body aches to make it real.\n\nI open my eyes, lips swollen, voice breaking, still whispering “I’m pretty, I’m pretty, please, please, fuck me, fill me, let me show you how soft and needy I can be—make me your favorite slut, your prettiest little thing, let everyone see what I am…” My hands slide lower, grinding against my cock, making it drool even more, hips rolling in little circles as I lose myself in the vision—begging, hoping, desperate to be seen, to be ruined, to be owned."

bno_femboi.1002.title.3: "Ugly Denial"
bno_femboi.1002.desc.3: "I clench my jaw, nails digging into my palms as I glare at my own reflection, fighting down every filthy urge boiling under my skin. My lips are trembling, my cheeks still flushed, cock still drooling, but I force myself to scowl, to straighten my back, to look away from the mirror and pretend I don’t see the softness, the hunger, the desperate, ruined little sissy hiding in my eyes. I spit a bitter curse, shove away from the table, and march out, thighs rubbing, body screaming for touch, for praise, for cock—but I choke it all down, lock it all away, pretending I’m still strong, still a man.\n\nEvery step away from the mirror is agony. Shame crawls under my skin, burning hotter than any touch. The memory of how I almost gave in—how close I was to pouting, giggling, begging to be called pretty—haunts every breath. I grind my teeth, fists clenched, willing myself to forget, to fight, to survive another day without surrendering. But the ache lingers, hollow and sharp, and I know I’ll only want it more tomorrow."
bno_femboi.1002.a.3: "Keep my head down and suffer in silence, trembling with shame"

bno_femboi.0003.title: "Strange Sensations at Night"
bno_femboi.0003.desc: "Night presses heavy, thick with the musk of breeding and sweat that never quite fades from the camp. I lie twisted in the dark, sheets damp with my own need, cock shrunk to a slick, useless nub against my thigh, drooling grool into the hollow of my leg. Every sound seems sharper after lights-out—echoes of moans and the deep, grunting thrusts of Bulls fucking their sluts in the open tents, Black seed flooding every pussy, every hole, every belly but mine.\n\nI press my thighs together, heat pooling low and deep, my hips tingling in a way I never felt before. Every inch of me is awake, restless, skin prickling where the air brushes over it, nipples hard and throbbing under my shirt. I grind against the mattress, shame twisting in my gut because I know it’s not enough—I’m hungry, empty, desperate, every nerve in my ass and belly screaming for more than the shallow friction I can get alone.\n\nI remember the Bull that watched me earlier, his cock so thick I could see it swinging beneath his rags, his laugh booming as he bragged about breeding another white slut until she couldn’t walk straight. I remember how his gaze lingered on my hips, how every word made me ache, wishing I could be the one drooling, gaping, filled for the whole camp to see.\n\nNow the hunger is worse. The ache is everywhere, stronger than fear or shame. My cock is softer, smaller, wetter—my ass tingles with every breath, my thoughts are filthier, wild with the need to be filled, bred, made into something new. I lie there panting, heart pounding, torn between squeezing my legs together and pushing them wide, afraid someone will hear the way I whimper, the way I gasp and grind and beg inside my head.\n\nThe urge to touch, to push deeper, to find relief—it's growing stronger, almost impossible to ignore. But for a moment, all I do is squirm in the dark, trapped by the hunger, helpless and waiting at the edge."

bno_femboi.1003.title.1: "Empty and Wanting"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.1: "The ache won’t fade—it just coils tighter with every breath, making my whole body tremble beneath the thin sheets. My thighs spread, knees falling open as I let my hand slip down, breath shuddering, every fingertip trailing slick across my belly and down between my legs. My cock is barely more than a nub now, drooling helplessly, almost numb except for the ache it leaves behind. My hips roll slow, desperate, chasing the friction that never really satisfies. It isn’t enough—I need something deeper, something filthier, something that might make the gnawing hunger finally, finally stop.\n\nI press my fingers lower, dipping between my cheeks, ass clenching as I find my hole, slick with grool and sweat. The touch makes me whimper, hips jerking, back arching off the mattress. I bite my lip to muffle a moan, but it slips out anyway, high and needy, the kind of sound the Bulls laugh at when they pass by the tents at night. I imagine one of them standing over me now, cock thick and veined, shadow swallowing my trembling body as he watches me fuck myself, desperate to be filled, to be bred, to be owned.\n\nI push my fingers inside, slow at first, savoring the stretch, the heat, the filthy slickness that makes me feel like I’m already fucked. My hole clenches around my own hand, hungry for something bigger, darker, rougher—something that will leave me drooling, leaking, unable to close my legs for days. I rock my hips, grinding my ass down against my palm, fucking myself harder as the pleasure builds, mouth open and wet, moaning into the night like a slut on display.\n\nEvery thrust makes me shake, sweat dripping down my sides, nipples aching, cock leaking more grool with every filthy thought that flashes through my mind. I see myself bent over in the breeding barn, blacked sluts and refugee bitches watching as Bulls line up behind me, laughing at how empty and desperate I am, how easy it is to make a white sissy beg. My body trembles, back arching as I moan for more, begging the darkness, the Bulls, anyone who might hear—“please, please, fill me, breed me, make me yours, make me pretty, make me open forever.”\n\nThe mattress creaks beneath me, sheets soaked, skin tingling as the heat builds, sharp and dizzying, burning through me until I’m grinding, gasping, every muscle locked as I fuck myself deeper, faster, chasing the fantasy of being split open by a Bull’s cock, of being filled with seed until it leaks from my hole and pools on the sheets, proof for everyone to see that I’m nothing but a blacked, owned, begging slut.\n\nWhen it’s over, I collapse, panting, fingers still buried deep, hole clenching on nothing, the ache fading into a sweet, slow pulse. I stare at the ceiling, body sticky and trembling, still wishing it was a Bull, not my hand, that had left me empty and wanting, desperate for more."
bno_femboi.1003.a.1: "Lie there leaking, hips twitching, still begging the darkness to send a Bull to finally fill me"

bno_femboi.1003.title.2: "Quiet Desperation"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.2: "I squeeze my eyes shut, heart pounding as I slide my hand down, fingers shaking with the hunger that won’t fade. My cock is just a sad, leaking nub, slick with grool that stains my thigh, nowhere near hard, just twitching with each needy pulse. I rub slow, pressing my palm tight against the swollen head, grinding my hips into the mattress in tiny, desperate circles, every movement slick and sticky, every sound in the dark suddenly deafening.\n\nMy breath hitches, chest heaving, mouth pressed hard into the pillow to muffle the whimpers I can’t stop. I hear them—deep voices, the low, rumbling laughter of Bulls echoing from across the camp, the moans of sluts being bred in the tents, the slap of balls and the wet, helpless squeals of girls split wide for cock. The sounds flood my head, making the heat in my belly twist and flare, shame and arousal tangling until I’m dizzy with it, thighs slick, body tense and shaking.\n\nI can’t let anyone know—can’t let the Bulls or the blacked sluts or the caged whitebois hear how needy I am, how filthy, how close I am to crying for a taste, a touch, a single word of praise. I bite my lip hard, grinding my nub with frantic, trembling fingers, hips jerking, fighting back every moan, every gasp, every desperate plea that wants to spill out and echo through the darkness.\n\nBut it’s never enough. I rub faster, chasing the edge, feeling my whole body burn as I imagine strong hands pinning me down, a heavy, black cock pressing to my lips, my ass, my sissy hole, filling me, using me, making me squirm and squeal until I’m leaking and broken, begging for more. The thought alone makes me whimper into the pillow, cock dribbling more grool as I shake and twitch, desperate and unsatisfied.\n\nThe pleasure is sharp, short, burning away as quickly as it comes, leaving me sticky and aching, the hunger barely dulled. I curl up, breath shuddering, still listening to the sounds of fucking and moaning all around me, still wishing it was my turn, my hole, my voice crying out for more."

bno_femboi.1003.title.3: "Too Weak to Resist"
bno_femboi.1003.desc.3: "I clamp my thighs together, curling in on myself beneath the thin, sticky sheets. My face is buried deep in the pillow, breath coming in hot, broken sobs as the ache under my skin turns raw, scraping, unbearable. My cock is nothing—just a leaking nub, pulsing with every heartbeat, drooling slick against my trembling leg. My hips grind into the mattress, but I refuse to touch, refuse to give in, even as every inch of my body screams for relief.\n\nI can hear them—Bulls grunting and breeding sluts out in the night, the slap of balls, the filthy wet squelch of holes being ruined, the gasping, begging cries of bitches split and filled over and over. Each sound is a knife of shame and longing, twisting deeper every time another slut moans or a Bull laughs. My cheeks are slick with tears. I rock myself, grinding my face deeper into the pillow to stifle the ragged whimpers that keep slipping out.\n\nThe urge to open my legs, to reach down, to beg for the touch that would make the hunger fade is overwhelming. My skin tingles, nipples hard, ass clenching empty and desperate. I shake with need, sobbing into the darkness, cursing my own weakness. My body won’t let me sleep, won’t let me rest, won’t let me forget the heavy, stretching emptiness between my thighs.\n\nEvery minute feels like an hour. I keep my legs clenched tight, trying to keep the ache inside, but it’s no use—my whole body aches to be split, to be filled, to be made into the sissy whore the Bulls laugh about, the one who can’t resist, can’t stop crying, can’t stop begging. I press my face deeper, tears soaking the pillow, shame and need swirling until I’m nothing but a shaking mess, empty and waiting, too weak to resist, too proud to give in."
bno_femboi.1003.a.3: "Cry myself to sleep, shivering with need, praying the ache will break me by morning"

bno_femboi.0004.title: "Teased by the Others"
bno_femboi.0004.desc: "The sun is barely up, the camp coming alive with the shouts and laughter of Bulls and blacked sluts at the wells and water pumps. My heart thuds as I slip out to wash, cheeks still flushed from the night’s hunger, legs wobbly, cock a useless little nub drooling into my drawers. I duck my head, hoping no one will notice the heat in my face, the way my hips roll a little more, the way my lips are pink and swollen, mouth still sticky from the dream of being filled.\n\nI bend over the basin, cool water stinging my cheeks, fingers trembling as I splash my face and rub at the shame that clings to my skin. But I’m not fast enough. I hear them behind me—two Bulls and a blacked slut, their voices loud and cruel, the slap of hands and the deep, rumbling laugh that always makes my hole clench. One of them whistles, and another sneers, “Look at this little sissy—bending over like he wants a cock up his ass.”\n\nThe words hit like a slap, sharp and stinging, but I can’t help it—my whole body shivers, cock twitching, cheeks burning as I try to hide the way I almost like it. The slut leans in, her hand heavy on my shoulder, breath hot in my ear. “Aw, don’t pout, sweetie. Maybe if you keep swaying those hips, one of them will split you open before breakfast.” The Bulls laugh, thick fingers running down my spine, their hands huge, possessive, making me feel small and pretty and so, so exposed.\n\nShame burns, but underneath it, something filthier blooms—pride, hunger, the desperate hope that maybe, just maybe, they’ll really do it. My ass pushes back without thinking, hips swaying as I rinse my hands, praying nobody notices how wet I’m getting, how much I want to be mocked, teased, broken open for their amusement. Their words echo in my head long after they wander off, laughter still ringing, leaving me trembling and dripping, ruined before the day has even begun."

bno_femboi.1004.desc.1: "I can’t help it—a giggle slips out, high and helpless, as I sway my hips even more, showing off my ass for the Bulls behind me. The sun is warm on my skin but my whole body feels hotter, needier, the blush burning across my cheeks as I hear their laughter deepen, rough and hungry. The blacked slut leans in, her voice syrupy and cruel in my ear. “See? Knew you wanted it, sissy. Show ‘em how pretty you can be.” Her hand trails down my back, fingers hooking in the waistband of my trousers, dragging them down over my ass, leaving me naked and exposed, cock nothing but a leaking nub twitching with shame.\n\nOne of the Bulls moves in close, towering over me, his cock already thick and hard, so dark and heavy it makes my breath hitch. He spits in his hand, strokes himself, and grins down at me, voice rumbling, “Sissies like you live for this, don’t they? Bend over. Let me see you drip.” My knees go weak, hole clenching, body shaking with anticipation as I brace myself against the basin, ass pushed back, begging to be split.\n\nThe slut giggles, kneeling next to me, pinching my useless cock between her fingers, stroking it with mocking little tugs, letting her spit dribble over the head as she coos, “Aw, poor baby—never gonna fuck anyone with this pathetic thing, are you? Bet it aches, bet it leaks just from being teased in front of real cock.” I whimper, cock drooling down her palm, hips rocking helplessly as the Bull presses his tip against my hole.\n\nHe doesn’t wait, just thrusts in, thick and brutal, splitting me open on the first push—“ahhh, mmm, fuck, fuck!”—my mouth falls open, eyes rolling back as the stretch burns, the weight of him filling me so deep I feel it in my belly. His hands clamp my hips, holding me steady as he pounds into me, balls slapping against my clit, every thrust forcing filthy moans and giggles from my lips, every squelch echoing in the morning air for all to hear.\n\nThe slut keeps teasing my nub, laughing as it spurts and leaks, never getting hard, just twitching uselessly while I’m used, ruined, bred in the open, Bulls watching, slut sneering, my whole body melting into the pleasure and humiliation. I’m nothing but a fuckhole now, a giggling, cock-hungry sissy moaning for more, praying he never stops, praying the whole camp sees what I’ve become."

bno_femboi.1004.desc.2: "My cheeks are burning, pulse fluttering wild as their laughter follows me through the camp. I keep my head down, mumbling a weak “thank you” without daring to meet anyone’s eyes. My heart is pounding, shame crawling up my throat, hands shaking as I clutch my shirt and hurry away from the water pump. Every step feels awkward, my hips swaying in spite of myself, cock leaking in my drawers, the echo of “sissy” ringing in my ears.\n\nI duck between tents, desperate to escape their jeers and the heat they’ve lit beneath my skin. Even in the shadows, I can feel their eyes on me, the Bulls’ voices booming, the slut’s cruel giggle looping in my mind. My chest aches, my body twitching with a hunger I can’t shake, humiliation burning under my skin like a fever.\n\nI find a dark, empty corner behind a tent and sink down, hugging my knees tight, breath coming in sharp, shallow pants. My cock is still dribbling, nipples hard, ass tingling with a need I can’t admit, the taste of their attention—harsh, mocking, filthy—making my whole body tremble. I bury my face in my hands, trying to will the feeling away, but all I can do is squirm and whimper, the urge to go back, to beg, to be seen gnawing at me even as I hide.\n\nI rock in place, biting my lip, fighting the shame and the heat, knowing that no matter how far I run, the hunger only gets worse, louder, harder to deny."

bno_femboi.1004.desc.3: "I grit my teeth and force a scowl, refusing to look at any of them as their laughter and mocking voices swirl around me. My face burns with shame, ears ringing with the word “sissy,” but I keep my head down, scrubbing harder at the basin as if I can wash the urge away. Every muscle in my body is tight, knuckles white where I grip the rim, jaw clenched until it aches.\n\nI hear the slut’s snicker, the Bulls’ heavy steps behind me, the lazy slap of a palm against my ass just to make me flinch. I try to stand tall, chest out, determined not to let them see how badly my cock aches, how my ass clenches at every word, every touch, every cruel laugh. But it’s impossible to hide—the way my hips shudder, my thighs press together, my cock dribbles grool into my pants just from the attention, even if it’s only meant to humiliate.\n\nI breathe hard, blinking back the sting in my eyes, refusing to turn or whimper or give them the satisfaction of seeing me break. Inside, though, I’m a mess—hunger twisting in my gut, hole aching, heart hammering against my ribs. The more I fight it, the more I want it: to bend, to beg, to be ruined for them all. But I shove the feeling down, nails biting my palms, pretending I’m still strong, still a man, even as every step away from the pump leaves me emptier, lonelier, more desperate than before.\n\nI walk away without a word, hands shaking, throat tight, shame eating at me, the hunger only getting harder to deny."

bno_femboi.0005.desc: "The sun’s high and hot, the air thick with dust and sweat, and I’m hauling water past the campfires when I hear footsteps behind me. I keep my head down, cheeks flushed, trying to hide how my hips sway with every step, cock a useless nub squished between sticky thighs, already leaking from the memory of the morning’s teasing. But then a voice calls out—deep, lazy, rolling through me like thunder. “Hey, you. Stop a second.”\n\nI freeze, pulse skipping, heart thudding in my chest as I turn to see her—a blacked slut with eyes sharp as knives, skin dark and glowing, hips wide, tits straining against her ragged dress. She leans against a tent post, grinning like she knows every filthy thought that’s ever crossed my mind. Next to her, a Bull lounges in the shade, cock already half-hard, stretching the front of his trousers, a smirk twisting his lips.\n\nThe slut saunters closer, circling me, her gaze raking up and down my trembling body. “You look different,” she says, loud enough for the whole path to hear. “Softer. Prettier.” Her hand slides under my chin, forcing me to meet her gaze. My cheeks burn, my lips tingle, and for a moment I can’t breathe—just shiver, cock oozing, the shame and thrill mixing until my knees go weak.\n\nThe Bull laughs, deep and rumbling, his eyes hungry, cock swelling as he watches the slut stroke my cheek. “Yeah, look at those lips. Bet he’s dying to wrap them around a cock.” My chest is tight, nipples aching, skin prickling everywhere her hand touches. I try to stammer a thank you, but my voice comes out thin and breathless, every word shaking as I blink up at them, desperate and terrified and so, so hungry for more.\n\nShe leans in, lips brushing my ear, voice syrupy and cruel. “If you keep getting softer, pretty boy, you’ll end up on your knees before every Bull in camp. Is that what you want?” Her fingers graze my nipple, making me gasp, hole clenching, cock spurting another pathetic dribble down my thigh. The Bull stands, looming over me, shadow swallowing my body as he laughs again. “He’s already halfway there. Bet he leaks just from a compliment.”\n\nMy whole body shakes as I nod, too weak to deny it, too desperate to hide the hunger swelling inside me. I want to beg, to drop to my knees, to prove how pretty and soft I am, to let them all see what their words do to me—how a single compliment can ruin a boy and turn him into a moaning, blushing, leaking little sissy, desperate to be bred, filled, and owned."

bno_femboi.1005.title.1: "Left Wanting"
bno_femboi.1005.desc.1: "My cheeks blaze as I meet her gaze, eyes wide, breath trembling. “T-thank you…” The words barely make it out, my voice so soft and needy even I can’t believe it’s mine. The blacked slut grins wider, thumb stroking my cheek, her nails grazing the flushed skin just beneath my jaw. The Bull beside her rumbles with laughter, cock swelling in his trousers, his attention burning through every scrap of my self-control.\n\nI can’t stop shaking. My cock drools a pathetic string of grool down my thigh, thighs pressing tight together as the thrill and the shame swirl inside me, hotter with every passing second. Her hand lingers, fingers tracing the curve of my jaw, then slides down to pinch my nipple right through my thin shirt, making me gasp, hips bucking helplessly, hole clenching with need.\n\nShe leans in, lips brushing my ear, whispering so only I can hear, “You like being called pretty, don’t you? You want them all to see you blush, to hear you thank them for noticing how soft and fuckable you’ve gotten?” Her words twist around me, sweet and filthy, and I nod before I even realize it, swallowing back a whimper as my cock twitches, leaking even more.\n\nThe Bull laughs again, big and loud, grabbing himself through his trousers as he stares me down. “Run along, sissy. Show off that little walk—let the whole camp see what a compliment does to you.” My knees threaten to buckle, legs weak as I stumble away, head spinning, shame burning beneath my skin. I can feel their eyes on me the whole way, every step a performance, my body aching to be grabbed, praised, bent, used—made into exactly what their words have promised I’ll become."

bno_femboi.1005.title.2: "Running Hot"
bno_femboi.1005.desc.2: "I turn on my heel before she can say another word, cheeks blazing, eyes burning with unshed tears and something even hotter. My cock is already drooling, a sticky trail running down my thigh as I rush past the campfires, hands trembling, heart hammering so loud I can barely hear the Bulls’ laughter and the slut’s mocking giggle behind me. I can’t make myself slow down—my hips sway with every frantic step, thighs slick, the memory of her fingers on my jaw, his hungry eyes on my ass, every compliment stoking the heat deeper.\n\nI duck behind the nearest tent, breath shallow and ragged, body pressed to the rough canvas as I try to will the shame away. My hand covers my mouth to muffle the whimpers, but it’s useless—the ache only grows, pulsing with every heartbeat, making my cock leak more, making my ass clench, making my knees weak with want. I can still feel her voice in my ear, syrupy and cruel, echoing: softer, prettier, sissy. The words repeat inside my head, making my chest tighten, nipples throb, hole twitch with need.\n\nI squeeze my thighs together, squirming against the wall, wishing I could run all the way home—wishing I could make the hunger stop. But the attention lingers, stinging sweet, burning through every layer of pride I thought I still had. I shudder, lost and shaking, face buried in my hands, trembling with the secret hope that next time they won’t let me get away, that next time, someone will drag me out, make me kneel, call me pretty until I’m moaning, dripping, ruined in front of everyone."

bno_femboi.1005.title.3: "Proving How"
bno_femboi.1005.desc.3: "My knees hit the dirt before I can even think, breath catching, heart pounding so loud I barely hear the Bull’s laughter or the slut’s gasp of delight. I look up at them, eyes wide, lips parted in a helpless pout, cheeks blazing as I beg—voice trembling, hungry, so filthy even I can barely believe it’s me. “Please… let me show you. I want to be pretty for you, want you to see what a good sissy I am. Use me. Make me moan. Make me your favorite slut.”\n\nThe Bull grins wide, towering over me, his cock already hard and stretching the front of his trousers, that massive shape promising to split me in two. The blacked slut kneels beside me, one hand stroking my hair, the other slipping under my shirt to pinch and twist my nipples until I’m gasping, whining, squirming on my knees. “Mmm, look at you—so desperate, so pretty, so wet,” she whispers, her voice thick with pride and scorn.\n\nHe unbuttons his trousers, cock slapping out, heavy and dark and leaking precum. My mouth waters, tongue lapping at my lips, my whole body trembling as I inch closer, nose pressed to his musky skin, breathing in that thick, dizzying scent of Bull and power and seed. “Open up, pretty bitch,” he growls, and I obey without hesitation, lips stretching wide, drool slipping down my chin as I take him deeper and deeper, “mmm, glk, glk,” my own cock a useless, dribbling nub rubbing in the dirt as I choke and moan for him.\n\nThe slut laughs, tugging my hair, pushing my head down until my nose is buried in his curls, my throat bulging with every slow thrust. “That’s it, sissy. Suck him. Show us how much you love being pretty, love being seen, love being owned.” My ass pushes back, hips rolling, moans echoing from my mouth to the camp, every inch of me burning with the filthy, perfect pride of being used in public, surrounded by Bulls and sluts and anyone who cares to watch.\n\nThe Bull holds my head, fucking my mouth until my jaw aches, until I’m dizzy and drooling, tears streaking my cheeks, my whole body alive and desperate. I gasp and choke, desperate for every drop of his seed, every slap of his cock against my lips, every filthy compliment the crowd throws at my trembling, ruined body. My mind swims, cock spurting weak grool into the dust, pride shattered, heart racing with the thrill of being their favorite, their prettiest, their best little slut."

bno_femboi.0006.title: "Secret Fantasies"
bno_femboi.0006.desc: "Chores drag on forever, my mind drifting with every slow sweep of the broom, every bucket sloshed across the dusty camp path. Sunlight flickers through the tents, but I hardly see it—I’m lost in the thick, syrupy heat of my own filthy daydreams. My hips sway as I work, lips parted, breath coming in little gasps as I imagine rough, Black hands grabbing my waist, strong fingers digging in, pulling me back against a cock so thick and heavy it makes my hole clench, my whole body ache to be stretched and filled.\n\nI picture myself bent over in the open, ass up, pale cheeks spread wide for every Bull and blacked slut to see, my mouth parted in a helpless moan, begging to be used. I imagine a crowd—refugees, Bulls, blacked sluts—circling around, jeering, stroking themselves as they watch me tremble, hips rolling, face smeared with drool and tears. Every filthy thought sends another hot wave down my spine, my cock drooling grool into my drawers, so small and weak it’s only good for leaking shame and need.\n\nI let my mind go deeper—picture myself being grabbed, pinned, forced to open wide as a Bull’s cock stuffs my mouth, my ass, my sissy hole. I fantasize about being passed around, used over and over, every hole stretched, every inch of me dripping with sweat, spit, and endless seed. In my mind, I moan and squeal, “please, more, fuck me, ruin me, make me pretty, make me yours.” My whole body tingles, nipples hard, thighs slick, my hands shaking as I scrub and sweep, pretending the broom is a cock, the bucket a Bull’s heavy balls slapping against my clit.\n\nThe fantasy burns so hot it’s all I can do not to touch myself, not to drop to my knees in the middle of the camp and beg for someone—anyone—to make it all come true. I feel exposed and raw, shame curling up my spine, but the hunger is stronger, a filthy, perfect ache that nothing can hide. Every whisper of wind, every shadow that passes, makes my heart race with the hope that maybe, maybe today, one of them will catch me and turn my secret dreams into a moaning, cock-drunk reality."
bno_femboi.0006.a: "Lose myself in the fantasy, hips rolling, face hot, dreaming of being bent and filled for all to see"

bno_femboi.0006.c: "Accidentally let a little moan slip, blushing furiously as I pray nobody heard"

bno_femboi.1006.title.1: "Dreaming to Drip"
bno_femboi.1006.desc.1: "I let the broom slip from my hand, the rough wood forgotten as my hips start rolling slow, helpless circles in the heat of the afternoon. My face burns, sweat running down my neck, lips parted in a dreamy, filthy gasp as I give in to the hunger twisting through my belly. My cock is nothing but a leaking nub, dribbling grool into my drawers, balls tight, thighs slick as I grind against the edge of a water bucket, desperate to feel anything—anything close to what I crave.\n\nI close my eyes and the camp fades away, replaced by the thick, sweet heat of a breeding barn. I’m naked and bent, pale ass high, cheeks spread wide for every Bull, every blacked slut, every filthy refugee who wants to watch me squirm and beg. I can almost hear them—deep, booming laughter, voices taunting me, hands slapping my ass, rough fingers stretching my hole, getting me ready for the first, thickest cock. I moan, a soft, needy sound, thighs trembling, back arching as I imagine it: the weight of a Bull’s cock pressing at my entrance, the stretch and burn as he shoves in, splitting me wider than I thought I could take.\n\nThe fantasy grows hotter, wilder, my hips grinding against the bucket, legs shaking, nipples hard and aching. I picture myself gagging on another Bull’s cock, drool running down my chin, eyes rolling back as I’m stuffed and used, ruined and stretched until all I can do is squeal and beg, voice breaking with every “please, fuck me, more, more, fill me, make me drip, make me yours.” I imagine the crowd—sluts giggling, whitebois caged and limp, Bulls grinning, every eye on me as I take every inch, every load, every slap and thrust, every filthy name they can throw at me.\n\nMy hand slides under my waistband, pressing my useless nub as I hump harder, breath hitching, sweat beading on my forehead. I want it so badly—want to be seen, want to be fucked, want to be nothing but a cock-hungry, blacked sissy whore for all to watch. My mouth forms the words without sound, lips mouthing “please, fill me, ruin me, fuck me in front of everyone, make me drip, make me moan, make me yours.”\n\nI shudder, body tensing, grinding through the wave of heat and humiliation, the fantasy so real I almost sob from the pleasure. My cock leaks, hole clenches, hips buck against the bucket, shame and joy mixing until I’m breathless, ruined, unable to stop myself from dreaming of the moment the fantasy finally comes true—when the whole camp will see me bent, filled, and dripping with seed, a sissy made for cock, for breeding, for endless, public moans."

bno_femboi.1006.title.2: "Grinding Through the Ache"
bno_femboi.1006.desc.2: "I blink hard, shaking the filthy thoughts from my head as best I can, forcing my hips to still and my breath to even out. My face is burning, sweat prickling my brow, cock a sticky, aching nub leaking in my drawers with every heartbeat. I grip the broom tight, scowling, trying to drown the hunger in the scrape of wood on dirt, in the muscle of my arms and the ache in my back. I scrub harder, pretending I don’t care, that I’m just another boy working, not a sissy daydreaming about being bent and filled in front of the whole camp.\n\nEvery sweep of the broom is a battle. My thoughts keep sliding back to those black hands on my hips, those deep voices in my ear, the way I’d moan and beg and squirm if anyone even looked at me too long. I try to bury it—grit my teeth, set my jaw, tell myself I’m better than this, that I can outwork the ache. But the shame stays hot, coiling tighter under my skin, every movement rubbing my thighs, every drag of the broom across the earth making my cock twitch, my hole clench, my chest flutter.\n\nI throw myself into the chores, jaw locked, heart pounding, cheeks still burning. No matter how hard I work, the ache is there—growing, gnawing, making me wonder how long I can keep pretending, how long before the fantasy breaks through and I find myself on my knees, begging for it in broad daylight, in front of everyone.\n\nBut for now, I force myself to work, every muscle tensed, every sweep a struggle, the ache stronger than ever and still impossible to ignore."
bno_femboi.1006.a.2: "Bite my lip, keep working, praying the ache doesn’t break me in front of everyone"

bno_femboi.1006.title.3: "Heard and Seen"
bno_femboi.1006.desc.3: "It slips out before I can stop it—a soft, high moan, trembling and desperate, escaping my lips right in the middle of the camp. My knees nearly buckle, broom clattering to the ground as I slap a hand over my mouth, cheeks burning, heart hammering so hard I think everyone must hear it. My cock twitches, leaking in my drawers, body suddenly burning with shame and fear and something hotter, wetter, needier than before.\n\nI glance around, praying nobody noticed, but a pair of Bulls lounging nearby lift their heads, smirking, eyes fixed on me. One nudges the other, their grins wide, hungry. A blacked slut passing with a basket stops, tilts her head, mouth curling into a wicked smile as she catches my eyes. “Did you just moan, little sissy?” she purrs loud enough for everyone to hear, voice dripping with mockery and promise.\n\nMy face goes crimson, breath coming in shallow gasps as the laughter swells around me. The Bulls sit up, lazy and amused, their cocks already swelling beneath their rags. The slut steps closer, basket forgotten, her hips rolling as she saunters up, voice low and teasing, “So needy you can’t even hold it in, hmm? Maybe you want us all to hear you beg.”\n\nI tremble, unable to move, fingers twisting in my skirt, cock drooling, thighs slick with shame and arousal. I shake my head, but my body betrays me—hips swaying, breath shuddering, nipples stiff beneath my shirt. The slut’s hand strokes my cheek, nails scraping down my neck, making me shiver and gasp again, a helpless sound, softer this time, but just as obvious.\n\nLaughter and filthy whispers spread through the camp. I want to disappear, to hide, but deep down I ache for their eyes, their hands, their cocks. Every second in their gaze leaves me trembling, weak, wanting only to drop to my knees and let them hear every filthy, desperate moan that escapes my lips."
bno_femboi.1006.a.3: "Blush, shiver, and let them hear another moan, too desperate to hide anymore"

bno_femboi.1111.title: "Budding Femboi – The First Bloom"
bno_femboi.1111.desc: "The sun is just rising when I wake, tongue thick and sticky with the taste of Bull cum, breathless from dreams where I’m bent and bred, mouth stuffed, throat sore, cheeks painted with seed. My whole body tingles with need—the changes impossible to ignore now, every inch softer, skin glowing with a feverish sheen, lips swollen from sucking and pouting, cheeks flushed a constant pink that makes me look half-drunk on lust and shame.\n\nI stretch, rolling onto my back, legs spread wide, hands sliding up under my shirt to cup my chest. My nipples are so sensitive it makes me gasp; I can’t help but knead them, massaging, tugging, hoping they’ll swell, desperate for breasts, for something to show how far I’ve fallen. My cock, barely more than a leaking nub, twitches and drools onto my belly—sweet, sticky nectar pooling in my navel, so delicious I have to scoop it up with my fingers, sucking them clean, addicted to the taste of my own sissy slick, moaning around each finger as I remember every time I’ve been split and filled by a Bull.\n\nI roll my hips, grinding into the mattress, lost in the memory of last night—down on my knees, mouth open, tongue lapping up thick, hot seed from the palm of a grinning refugee, the rest of the Bulls watching, stroking their cocks, calling me “pretty bitch,” “seed sponge,” “little cumdump.” I sucked until my jaw ached, until my lips were bruised and shiny, until my belly was warm and full, my ass still gaping and twitching from being fucked open in front of the fire. The memory makes my hole clench, makes my cock spurt another sticky bead, my body melting with the urge to taste, to serve, to drink down every drop I’m given.\n\nOutside, I parade through camp, hips swaying, ass bouncing, chest thrust out, lips still glossy from a fresh coat of my own nectar. The Bulls call for me, hands outstretched, cocks already leaking, blacked sluts smirking as I drop to my knees, tongue out, begging to suck, to be filled, to make myself even softer, even sweeter, even more theirs. I moan for every inch, let my drool spill, worship each Bull until my voice cracks and my mind swims, seed dripping down my chin as I massage my chest, hoping the touch, the filth, the worship will make my breasts swell and my body blossom even further.\n\nBy nightfall, I’m back in my bed, skin glazed with sweat and cum, lips sore, nipples aching, cock shrunken and useless but still leaking sweet, addictive nectar. I finger myself slow, massaging my chest, tongue lapping at my own mess, whispering “please, more, make me softer, sweeter, let me be your favorite little slut.” I drift to sleep dizzy with lust, mouth still wet, body humming, knowing I’ll wake even deeper, even filthier, even more desperate to be used."
