bno_femboi.0001.title: "First Hunger"
bno_femboi.0001.desc: "I can’t eat. I push the bread around my plate, swallow a little broth, but it’s all tasteless, useless. My belly growls, but it isn’t for food—it’s for something else. Ever since I tasted that Elixir, my tongue can’t forget the thick sweetness. I keep thinking about him—the Bull I saw by the stable, his skin so dark it makes my breath catch, the weight of his cock showing through his tunic, the way he looked right at me, like he knew what I’d become.\n\nI haven’t changed. I look down at myself: just a flat chest, plain hips, my cock hanging soft and sad. When I touch myself, it barely twitches. I remember when I used to jerk off and it felt good, but now I just feel empty, raw, like my hand isn’t enough. My fingers drift between my legs, down to my ass, and I wonder—would it feel different if I pushed inside? Would it make me feel full, like I’m supposed to be?\n\nThe worst part is the hunger. It doesn’t fade, not even after I guzzle down milk and try to pretend it’s something hotter, thicker, something that would leave my lips sticky and my belly warm. I stand by the window, licking the last white drops from my mouth, wishing it were his, wishing he’d use me, fill me up. I press my thighs together and shudder, my skin hot, my thoughts filthy, every inch of me desperate to be noticed, used, remade.\n\nI know nothing has changed on the outside. But inside, I’m falling apart. I can’t stop thinking about being on my knees, begging for cock, drinking every drop, letting myself be ruined. I ache, I tremble, and no matter how I try to fight it, the hunger just grows."
