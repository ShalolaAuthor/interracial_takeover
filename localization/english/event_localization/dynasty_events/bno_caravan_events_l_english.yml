 bno_caravan.0001.title.bbc: "The Caravan Bows to the Bull"
 bno_caravan.0001.desc.bbc: "The road to the Obsidian Caravan is lined with sluts already on their knees, tits swaying, cunts dripping, their moans rising as I pass. They are not here to sell, they are here to worship—holes spread, tongues out, eyes glazed with lust. Whitebois skulk in the shadows, clutching their shriveled worms, some already wetting themselves just to be this close to Bulls’ domain.\n\nWhen I reach the tents, the air thickens with musk and incense, a haze of sweat and seed that clings to my skin. The wagons are no merchant carts—they are altars. Cages rattle, piercings glint, tinctures glimmer in glass vials like bottled destiny. The very air hums with surrender.\n\nThe Bulls guarding the entrance step aside instantly, eyes lowered, fists pressed to their chests in salute. They demand no toll; they would not dare. My presence is payment enough. The shopkeeper himself bends low, his silks brushing the dirt as he bows, arms spread wide to reveal the treasures within. Behind him sluts are already bent over benches, holes stuffed with mock cocks of ebony wood, moaning to entice me further inside.\n\nEvery step into the caravan’s heart is greeted with wet sounds—squelch, gag, slurp—as the goods are “demonstrated” on eager livestock. A bitch whimpers around a dog’s knot in one corner, a mare squeals as she’s mounted in another, and a row of pale sluts drink tinctures from glass vials as if they were chalices of holy seed.\n\nThis is not a market. This is conquest embodied. And it is mine to command."
 bno_caravan.0001.a.bbc: "The wares are mine to claim."

 bno_caravan.0001.title.female: "The Caravan’s Price for a Slut"
 bno_caravan.0001.desc.female: "The road reeks of incense and sweat before I even see the tents. Black banners whip in the wind, wagons creak heavy with cages and vials, and the air itself hums like a moan. Bulls guard the entrance, their eyes dragging over me as if they already feel my cunt clench around them. Their palms extend, wordless, demanding toll: gold… or holes.\n\nMy purse feels so light. I squeeze it tight against my hip, praying it will be enough, knowing it won’t be. The Bulls’ smirks widen, already certain how I’ll pay if the coins don’t jingle right. Behind them, I hear wet sounds—sluts gagging on cock, squealing on wooden benches, their dripping holes put on display beside tinctures and chains. A glass vial gleams in lamplight, promising transformation, promising ruin.\n\nMy body trembles between shame and heat. I know I could pay with coin, or I could spread my legs, offer my moans as currency. Yet another voice whispers in me: I could turn away. I could deny myself the Caravan’s filth, stay pure just a little longer. The thought makes me ache all the more.\n\nThe silk curtains sway, and the choice hangs thick in the musk."
 bno_caravan.0001.a.female: "I’ll pay with gold if I can."
 bno_caravan.0001.b.female: "Let them take me as toll."
 bno_caravan.0001.c.curious: "No… I dare not enter."

 bno_caravan.0001.title.male: "A Worm Before the Caravan"
 bno_caravan.0001.desc.male: "The Caravan towers above me, black silk banners rippling, incense thick with musk that makes my chest tighten and my knees weak. Bulls stand at the entrance like gods, their laughter sharp enough to slice me open. I clutch my purse so tight my knuckles ache, praying the coins inside will be enough to buy me mercy.\n\nOne Bull crooks his finger, palm wide, waiting. A hundred gold or nothing. If I have it, they’ll let me crawl past, mocked and scorned, but allowed to glimpse what lies within. If not, I see the glimmer in his eyes, the cruel curl of his lips—he already knows I’ll end up on my knees, paying the toll with my mouth around his cock.\n\nFrom beyond the curtain come the sounds that make me tremble: sluts squealing, gagging, dripping as Bulls rut them raw; vials clinking as tinctures are poured; and the metallic click of locks snapping shut. I peer closer and my stomach knots. It isn’t cages for bodies—it’s cages for cocks. Rows of gleaming steel devices line the tables inside, polished until they blind the eye, some spade-shaped, others pierced with cruel studs. A merchant demonstrates, snapping one closed around a whimpering worm, the small cock mashed flat, trapped forever behind steel. The whiteboi shakes as the Bulls roar, the little dribble of precum leaking through the drainage holes like a mockery of seed.\n\nI swallow hard, shame burning my skin. My cock twitches in my trousers, pathetic, useless, already imagining how it would feel locked away, denied forever, mocked as sluts moan for real cocks just an arm’s length away. The Bulls’ eyes pin me, daring me to step forward. Gold, my mouth, or cowardice—those are the only paths for a worm like me."
 bno_caravan.0001.a.male: "I clutch my gold and pay."
 bno_caravan.0001.b.male: "I drop to my knees and serve."
 bno_caravan.0001.c.cuckish: "No—I flee from the Caravan."

 bno_caravan.1001.title.female: "The Slut Pays in Gold"
 bno_caravan.1001.desc.female: "The Bulls at the entrance don’t move until I dig out my purse. Their palms open, smirks daring me to come up short. My fingers tremble as I drop coin after coin into their hands until the clink of gold finally satisfies them. They grunt approval, parting the curtains with a sweep of silk.\n\nThe air inside hits me like a wall—hot, heavy with incense, and saturated with the stink of cock and sweat. I clutch my now-light purse tighter, heart pounding as I step deeper. The Caravan isn’t a market; it’s a temple of seed. Tables groan under rows of black-glass vials, each one shimmering with dark promise. Chains sway from hooks, cages rattle with pale sluts moaning inside, and piercings glint in lamplight like crowns waiting for holes to claim.\n\nEverywhere I look, Bulls loom. They don’t try to sell me anything. They don’t have to. Their eyes rake my body, their cocks bulging under silk as if daring me to forget that coin bought me passage, not dignity. A merchant laughs as he tips a tincture down a slut’s throat, her gagging moans filling the tent. Another forces a whiteboi to drink from a vial, watching him tremble and collapse to his knees.\n\nThe Bulls herd me slowly through the aisles, making me see it all—the tinctures, the elixirs, the cages, the brands. My gold has paid for entry, but I can feel the moment building, the inevitable choice pressing closer with every step.\n\nI am inside the Caravan now. I cannot turn back. Soon, they will demand to know what I came here for."
 bno_caravan.1001.a.slut: "Mmm… every moan makes me wetter."

 bno_caravan.2001.title.female: "The Slut Pays with Her Holes"
 bno_caravan.2001.desc.female: "The Bulls at the entrance laugh when they see the tremble of my empty hands. No purse. No coin. Only a body wet with need. One grips my chin, tilting my face up, thumb smearing the spit from my bitten lip. “Then pay the proper toll, slut.”\n\nThe silk curtain never opens at once. First, I am dragged to my knees in the dust, cock slapped across my cheeks until my mouth parts. Slurp, gag, ahhh—seed gushes down my throat, thick and endless, flooding my belly until I choke and drool across my tits. Another Bull shoves me forward, my ass yanked high, his cock ramming deep into my cunt with a squelch that makes the others roar. I’m passed between them like a coin-purse, every hole stretched and dripping, cunt and ass stuffed until I’m squealing, throat too full to breathe.\n\nBy the time they’ve finished, I’m sprawled in the dirt, belly heavy with seed, pussy leaking down my thighs. One Bull hauls me up by the hair, spit-and-cum dripping from my mouth, and shoves me through the silken curtains at last.\n\nInside, the Caravan’s treasures blaze in the lamplight—tinctures, elixirs, cages, chains, brands. The air is thick with musk, sluts moaning from cages, worms trembling under Bulls’ hands. I stumble forward on shaky legs, still dripping from the toll I’ve just paid, but the wares are now laid bare before me. My gold was my holes, and I’ve spent it well."
 bno_caravan.2001.a.slut: "Mmm, I lick my lips, dripping."

 bno_caravan.1001.title.male: "Gold Buys Me Passage"
 bno_caravan.1001.desc.male: "My hands shake as I dig into the purse, the leather slick with sweat. The Bull’s palm hovers open, steady and merciless, his eyes daring me to come up short. One coin drops, then another, then another—clink, clink, clink—each louder than my heartbeat, louder than the laughter around me. By the time the last piece of gold spills out, my purse hangs empty and light.\n\nHe doesn’t even bother to count. He weighs the pile like pebbles, sneers, and tosses it aside. All that mattered was watching me squirm, watching me tremble as I bled my wealth into his hand. The curtain parts, and hot air rolls over me, heavy with incense, musk, and the stink of seed. I shuffle forward, head bowed, every step dragging with shame.\n\nInside, the wares gleam under lantern light. Vials of tincture shimmer dark and thick, the Tincture of Genesis glowing milky-white like bottled seed. The Elixir of the Black Womb glows gold-red, swirling as if alive, promising hunger and ruin. Rows of polished steel cages glint like mirrors—devices made to crush worms like me, each click of their locks a death knell to pride. Merchants snap them shut over trembling whitebois, the sound sharp as thunder, the tiny cocks inside mashed and dripping through their holes.\n\nI swallow hard, my own cock shriveling as I watch, my stomach twisted into knots. My gold is gone, spent like spit in the dirt, and in return I am given only this: permission to see the tools that will unmake me. The Bulls laugh behind me, their cocks straining in their silks, their eyes reminding me that gold may buy passage—but nothing can buy dignity."
 bno_caravan.1001.a.whiteboi: "I have paid—now let me in."

 bno_caravan.2001.title.male: "The Worm Pays with His Mouth"
 bno_caravan.2001.desc.male: "My purse is empty. The Bull’s palm waits open, but I have nothing to give. His smirk deepens, cruel and hungry, as he steps closer. Fingers like iron grip the back of my neck and shove me down, the dust clinging to my knees. Laughter erupts around me, sharp and merciless, as the shopkeeper unties his silks and lets his cock fall free—thick, veined, glistening in the lantern light.\n\n“On your knees, worm,” he growls, pressing the heavy length against my lips. “Pay with that mouth.” The head smears pre across my trembling lips, the stink of musk filling my nose until my eyes water. My throat works in a dry swallow, shame burning hot, but the Bulls’ eyes pin me in place. They will not let me stand until I’ve opened.\n\nI part my lips, barely a whimper escaping before the cock drives in. Slurp, gag, gghhhk—my throat bulges, spit pouring down my chin as he fucks my face like it’s another pussy to ruin. His balls slap wet against my jaw, his cock choking me until I can’t breathe, until my vision blurs and my body shakes. The Bulls roar with laughter, mocking my gagging, my drooling, my tears dripping onto the dirt.\n\nWhen he cums, it’s a flood. Hot, salty seed gushes down my throat, filling my belly until I sputter and choke. It spills from my nose, strings of it clinging to my chin. He pulls free with a wet pop, smearing the last drops across my face before shoving me forward. My body trembles, my mouth dripping cum and spit, my knees raw from the ground.\n\nOnly then does the curtain part. The musk of the Caravan crashes over me—tinctures glowing on tables, steel chastity cages gleaming under lamplight, sluts squealing as Bulls rut them in cages meant for holes, not bodies. My payment is made. My mouth was my coin, and now I’m allowed inside."
 bno_caravan.2001.a.whiteboi: "The Bulls laugh as I crawl."

 bno_caravan.0002.title.bbc: "The Bull Claims the Caravan’s Treasures"
 bno_caravan.0002.desc.bbc: "The curtains part fully for me, and the air inside the Obsidian Caravan is hotter, thicker, a stew of incense, musk, and the squelching chorus of sluts being used as living displays. Tables groan beneath rows of vials and jars, tinctures glowing dark and viscous, each bottle trembling as though alive. Chains and collars hang from hooks, piercings gleam like crowns, cages rattle softly as pale sluts whimper inside, their holes already stretched wide for inspection.\n\nSluts bend themselves over benches, moaning as wooden mock-cocks split them for show, every squeal timed with a merchant’s description of what the tincture or brand before me can do. “This one, my lord, the Tincture of Genesis — make her live on your cum alone.” A glass vial is pressed toward me, the slut on the bench gagging, drool foaming as she drinks one down, her pale skin already shading darker where seed drips across her tits.\n\nAnother merchant calls me over, displaying the Elixir of the Black Womb. He tilts the head of a bound whiteboi back, pouring the thick black liquid between his lips. The worm coughs, sputters, then goes glassy-eyed, clutching his useless cock as though something inside him is gnawing to be fed. The Bulls roar with laughter, shoving him forward to lick seed from the floor.\n\nCages line the path, each with a different model: iron bars for public shame, leather straps for travel, gilded spade-shaped locks to mark ownership forever. Sluts inside rattle them, moaning for me to take them out, to leash them. Above it all, the merchants watch me nervously but reverently — because I do not haggle. I do not ask. I decide.\n\nEverything is mine. The only question is which prize I’ll take first."

 bno_caravan.0002.desc.female: "The tent hums with heat, musk, and moans. Before me, the table glistens with treasures that could unmake me, remake me, bind me forever in seed.\n\nAt the center stands a squat, dark vessel capped with a red crystal, its belly sloshing with a milky-white fluid that almost seems to breathe. The Tincture of Genesis. Bulls whisper that a single swallow binds a slut’s life to her Bull’s cock, that she will live only on his cum, her skin darkening day by day as her womb ripens beneath his seed.\n\nBeside it gleams a tall, ornate flask traced in gold vines, crowned with a spade finial. Inside, the liquid glows crimson-gold, swirling like living fire. The Elixir of the Black Womb. They say it hollows worms into hungry addicts, makes whitebois ache until they beg to swallow seed, their bodies reshaped slowly with every drip down their throats.\n\nChains and cages line the shelves around them, rattling with sluts inside. Brands and piercings shimmer, waiting to mark skin and seal obedience. All around me Bulls smirk, their cocks bulging as they watch me tremble.\n\nI ache with hunger, cunt dripping, breath shallow. The choice hangs in the air, thick as musk."

 bno_caravan.0002.title.male: "The Caravan’s Wares Laid Bare"
 bno_caravan.0002.desc.male: "I stumble past the silk curtain, my knees aching, my chin slick with spit and cum. The Bulls’ laughter still echoes behind me, their voices booming like drums in my ears. Inside, the air is thicker, choking with incense and musk. Heat presses down like a weight, every breath dragging the stink of sweat, seed, and shame deeper into my chest.\n\nTables stretch before me, sagging beneath treasures that make my cock shrivel. The Tincture of Genesis sloshes in its dark glass belly, white and thick, glowing like bottled seed. Beside it gleams the Elixir of the Black Womb, crimson-gold, swirling like fire, promising hunger that will gnaw a worm hollow until only cock and cum can sate it.\n\nBeyond the vials, rows of chastity cages glitter under lantern light—polished steel rings, tubes, and spade-shaped locks gleaming cruelly. Merchants snap them shut around trembling worms, the metallic click sharp as thunder. Whitebois whimper as their pathetic cocks are mashed into steel, little dribbles leaking through drainage holes, mocked as Bulls roar in delight. The sight makes my stomach churn; it’s too easy to imagine one snapped around me, forever denying me what I already cannot give.\n\nSluts moan in the corners, bent over benches, holes stuffed and dripping as they’re “demonstrated” alongside the wares. Piercings glint from swollen pussies and gaping asses, brands burn fresh across pale skin, their bodies trembling but their moans rising like prayers. The whole tent is a temple of cock and seed, every item soaked in filth, every sound a hymn of ownership.\n\nI paid the toll. I’m inside now. And the Bulls are watching, waiting to see what catches my eye first."
