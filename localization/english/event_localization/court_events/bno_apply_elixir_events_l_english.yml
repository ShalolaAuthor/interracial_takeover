bno_apply_elixir.0001.desc.slut.bbc: "The vial is heavy in my hands, black glass glowing faintly, the liquid inside thick and white like cum. The Tincture of Genesis. Every slut knows what it does — once swallowed, a Bull’s seed is forever changed. His cum will reshape any slut he breeds: skin darker, tits heavier, hips wider, pussy dripping hotter, womb always ready.\n\nI kneel before [recipient.GetFirstName], staring up at him, breath shallow, cunt aching. His cock bulges under his silks, already so hard, already twitching like it knows what’s coming. My fingers shake as I pull the stopper. The sharp-sweet scent of the tincture makes my pussy clench, juices sliding down my thighs.\n\nHe says nothing, only stares, his eyes heavy and commanding. My heart pounds as I lift the vial, tilting it toward his lips. I imagine it spilling down his throat, sinking into his balls, twisting his cum into something greater, something no slut can resist. I can see it in my mind — me on all fours, his load flooding me, my body swelling, changing, dripping, becoming more perfect every time he fills me.\n\n“Drink, [recipient.GetFirstName]…” I whisper, voice breaking into a moan. “Transform your seed. Make me your slut forever.”\n\nThe vial brushes his mouth, the moment hanging heavy. I ache for him to drink it, to feel his cum remade, to know every thrust will mark me deeper. And yet — a tremor of hesitation claws at me. The choice is mine: give him the elixir, or pull it back."

bno_apply_elixir.1001.desc.slut.bbc: "The slut [actor.GetFirstName] kneels before me, her hands trembling as she lifts the black vial. I can smell it even before she pulls the stopper free — sharp, sweet, heavy with a musk that makes my cock throb. The Tincture of Genesis. I know what it means. Once I drink, my cum will never be the same. Every load I spill will change the sluts I fuck — darker, tighter, wetter, more perfect each time I breed them.\n\nHer eyes flick up to me, wide, desperate. She licks her lips as if she can already taste what my seed will become. When she tilts the vial against my mouth, I don’t hesitate. I drink deep. The liquid slides thick down my throat, hotter than fire, settling low in my gut before it spreads to my balls.\n\nA pulse hits me hard. My cock jerks in my silks, thick veins straining as the burn coils inside. I groan, low in my chest, fists clenching as the power seeps through me. I can feel it — my cum is different now. Not just seed, but transformation. Any slut I flood will be remade, her body reshaped by my breeding.\n\nI look down at [actor.GetFirstName]. She’s panting, thighs pressed together, watching my cock twitch with hunger in her eyes. She knows I’m changed. She knows the next time I spill inside her, it will mark her forever."

Every slut knows its power — it remakes Bulls into living gods, their cum transforming us into dripping perfection. But in the mouth of a worm, it’s no blessing. It’s punishment.\n\n[recipient.GetFirstName] looks up at me, eyes wide, throat tight with fear. His soft little cock twitches in confusion, as if he really thinks he’s about to be made into something greater. Pathetic. I laugh, cruel and low, knowing exactly what this will do to him.\n\nI grab his chin, nails biting into his skin, and shove the vial against his lips. He squirms, sputters, trying to turn away, but I hold him firm. The liquid pours thick into his mouth, burning as it goes. He gags, coughs, then swallows — because he has no choice.\n\nIt hits him almost instantly. He gasps, clutches at his cock, eyes bulging in horror as it shrivels in his hands. His balls tighten, shrivel, wither like rotten fruit, leaving nothing but a useless worm between his legs. Tears streak his cheeks as he stares at me, broken, realizing his manhood is gone forever.\n\nI lean down, my voice a hiss of pleasure in his ear. “That was never meant for you. You’re castrated now — just a toy for the BNWO.”"

[actor.GetFirstName]’s grip is iron, her nails digging into my skin, her eyes filled with cruel delight. I try to turn away, but the thick liquid pours into my mouth anyway, hot and heavy, burning down my throat until I choke and swallow.\n\nAt first there’s only the heat. Then it drops lower, settling in my gut like molten lead. A pulse rips through me and I double over, clutching my cock. I gasp, eyes wide, horror flooding me as I feel it twitch, then soften, then shrivel. My balls tighten against me, shrinking smaller and smaller until they ache like they’re being crushed.\n\nI whimper, tears streaming, staring down at myself in disbelief. My cock hangs limp, shriveled, useless. No surge of hardness comes, no stirring in my balls. I know instantly — it’s gone. I will never rise again, never spill a load. I’m empty.\n\nI hear her voice in my ear, sweet and sharp. “That was never meant for you. Now you’re nothing.” The words cut deeper than the burn, and I feel my whole body sag in defeat. The BNWO has erased me."

Once I drink it, my cum will never again be ordinary. Every load I spill will reshape sluts who take it — their tits swelling, hips widening, skin darkening, wombs ripening, bodies perfected under the BNWO.\n\nI pull the stopper free. The scent is sharp and sweet, like cum thick in the back of a throat. My cock throbs just from the smell. I tip the vial back and drink it down in one long swallow. The liquid is heavy, molten, sliding hot down my throat until it settles low, deep in my gut.\n\nThen it hits. A pulse, strong as a fist, slams through me. My balls ache, clench, then swell, heat coursing into them as if every drop of seed inside is being reforged. My cock jerks against my thigh, thick veins bulging, the head flaring as if it knows it has changed. I groan, low and guttural, fists curling tight as the fire spreads through me.\n\nI can feel it — my cum is different now. Not just seed, but transformation. The next slut I breed will not leave unchanged. My loads will darken her skin, plump her tits, flare her hips, mark her forever as mine. I am more than a Bull now. I am the BNWO made flesh."

My cock jerks thick and angry in my silks, every vein standing out, the head flushed and leaking. I know without doubt — my cum is different now. It needs to be tested.\n\nI seize [slut.GetFirstName] by the wrist and drag her down, shoving her to her knees. She gasps when my cock springs free, thicker than before, slick with precum that drips heavy onto her lips. She moans at the sight, mouth open, tongue darting as if she already senses the change.\n\nBut I don’t give her the choice. I bend her over, spreading her hole wide, and slam in to the base. Her scream breaks into a needy cry as my transformed cock splits her open. I pound her hard, every thrust deeper, her cunt sucking greedily at me as if desperate to keep the seed I’m about to spill.\n\nWhen release comes, I roar and grind deep, balls slapping against her ass as I unload everything. The cum pours into her womb in heavy floods, hotter, thicker, endless. She claws the ground, sobbing and moaning as it fills her, her belly swelling under my weight.\n\nThe change is instant. I watch her skin deepen shade by shade, her tits swell larger against the dirt, her hips flare wider around my grip, her waist cinching tighter. She shudders violently, every gasp wetter, higher, broken with pleasure as my seed remakes her body from the inside out.\n\nI hold her down as the last spurts pump into her, grinning as she trembles beneath me. My new seed works perfectly. She is dripping, transformed, and still begging for more."

They call it the Tincture of Genesis — sacred, forbidden, made to transform the cum of Bulls into power that remakes sluts forever.\n\nBut what if I drank it? My throat is dry just thinking it. I imagine strength flooding me, my seed suddenly potent, making sluts moan for me. My cock twitches weakly at the thought, a pale imitation of the Bulls I envy.\n\nAnd yet… the whispers echo in my head. Worms like me aren’t meant for this. Our bodies are too weak. The Tincture doesn’t sanctify us — it unmakes us. I’ve heard the stories of whitebois shriveling, balls withering, cocks hanging limp forever after a single sip.\n\nI stare at the vial. My hand shakes. Is this my chance to rise… or the final proof that I was never a man at all?"

For a moment, I wait for strength, for power, for the surge I’ve seen in Bulls. My chest heaves, my heart pounds, hope flickering weakly in my chest.\n\nThen the burn drops lower. My cock stiffens for a heartbeat, twitching in my trousers, and then — horror. The ache twists deep in my balls, sharp and merciless. I gasp, doubling over, clutching myself as if I can hold my manhood together. My cock softens, shrivels in my hand. My balls tighten, shrivel, collapse against me like rotten fruit.\n\nI whimper, tears running down my cheeks, staring down in disbelief. There is no surge of virility. No power. Only loss. The Tincture was never meant for me. It rejects me, marks me, unmakes me. My cock will never rise again. My seed is gone.\n\nI collapse to my knees, trembling, broken, knowing the BNWO has stripped me of even the illusion of being a man. I am barren now — a castrated worm."

The scent spills into the air — sharp, sweet, thick with promise. His cock twitches under his silks, already aching for what’s inside. When he tips the vial back and drinks, I watch closely, a thrill running through me.\n\nThe change is immediate. He shudders, groaning as the Tincture burns through him. His balls swell heavy, his cock jerks, harder, thicker, leaking with transformed seed. I can feel it just by standing near him — his loads are different now.

The fluid is thick, burning hot as it slides down my throat, sinking heavy into my gut. A heartbeat later, the fire drops lower. My balls clench hard, then swell, aching with a pressure that nearly drops me to my knees.\n\nI groan, fists curling, as my cock jerks against my thigh — harder, thicker, every vein bulging. Precum leaks in heavy drops, the head flushed and angry, throbbing with new power. The fire doesn’t hurt; it transforms. I can feel it in my core, in my balls — my cum is no longer just seed. It is the BNWO made flesh, potent enough to reshape sluts with every breeding.\n\nI lift my head, chest heaving, and catch [actor.GetFirstName] watching me. He sees it too. My cock is different now.

But when forced into the mouth of a worm like [recipient.GetFirstName], it is a curse.\n\nI grab his chin, tilting his head back. His eyes are wide, throat trembling, his limp little cock twitching in fear. “Drink,” I snarl, shoving the vial against his lips. He sputters, shakes his head, but I force it in, the liquid spilling down his throat until he chokes it down.\n\nThe change is instant. He gasps, clutching himself, his cock stiffening weakly once — then wilting in my grip. His balls clench tight, then shrivel, collapsing into useless husks. He whimpers, tears streaking his face, staring down in disbelief as his manhood withers between his fingers.\n\nI laugh, the sound low and cruel. “The Tincture was never for worms like you.

My cock twitches in my trousers, a pathetic little stir, and I think maybe it’s working — maybe I’ll feel the power Bulls boast about. My heart pounds, waiting, desperate.\n\nThen the pain strikes.\n\nIt hits my balls first — a crushing ache that doubles me over, tearing a scream from my throat. My hands fly down between my legs, clutching at myself, but it only makes the horror clearer. My cock stiffens for a single weak pulse, then wilts in my grip, softening until it hangs useless. My balls seize tight, pulled up hard against me, then begin to shrivel.\n\nI sob as I feel them collapse in my palm, shrinking smaller and smaller, each spasm leaving them hollower, emptier, until they’re nothing but loose skin. The ache doesn’t stop; it gnaws, relentless, until I’m gasping, drooling, tears streaking my face. My cock shrivels further, the head wrinkling, no strength left in it.\n\nI fall to my knees, staring down at the ruin between my thighs. No hardness, no seed, no future. Just a limp strip of flesh and an empty sac. The Tincture hasn’t blessed me. It’s unmanned me. I can feel the truth in my bones — I will never cum again.\n\nAbove me, the Bull laughs, the sound deep and cruel, while sluts giggle and point.

Once drunk, it changes a Bull’s seed forever — his cock marked, his loads remaking sluts until they’re dripping perfection.\n\nI kneel before [recipient.GetFirstName], my chest tight, my useless cock twitching soft in shame. He towers over me, silk straining around the heavy bulge of his cock, the heat of his musk choking me where I bow. My mouth waters, my throat dry, as I lift the vial up with both hands like an offering at an altar.\n\n“Drink, [recipient.GetFirstName]…” My voice cracks, breaking on the words. “Please… let me give this to you.”\n\nHe doesn’t thank me. He doesn’t need to. His eyes stay cold, commanding, as he takes the vial from my shaking hands. He tips it back in one motion, swallowing it all. I can hear him groan, deep and rumbling, as the liquid burns into him.\n\nIt hits him fast. His cock jerks against the silk, swelling, thickening, precum soaking the fabric. His balls drop heavy, swollen with new weight, transformed before my eyes. The air itself feels different, thick with power, musk flooding out of him until my eyes water and my lips part in a moan I can’t stop.\n\nI’m hard — not in my cock, never there, but in the ache spreading through me.

He can hand it to me.\n\nI take the vial from his trembling hands without a word. It’s warm, black glass glowing faintly, the liquid inside thick and white like seed. My cock throbs hard at just holding it. I pull the stopper and lift it to my lips, drinking it down in one long swallow.\n\nThe burn slams into me. It slides down my throat, then drops heavy into my gut before igniting lower. My balls seize, then swell, aching with a heat so sharp I groan out loud. My cock jerks, slapping against my thigh, swelling harder, thicker, veins bulging until precum drips in heavy strings. The air itself tastes different, thick with musk, my scent filling the tent until the slut-kneeler whimpers just from breathing it.\n\nI look down at him — [actor.GetFirstName] on his knees, staring up at me, tears in his eyes, lips parted as if he wants to beg for my cock. He can see it. He knows. My seed isn’t just cum anymore. Every load I spill will darken sluts’ skin, swell their tits, widen their hips, ripen their wombs. My balls pulse with that truth, heavy and burning with power.\n\nI laugh, low and rough, precum dripping onto the floor between us. “You gave me the vial.

I know what he’ll become.\n\nHe cracks a nervous smile, says something I barely hear. He thinks this is just another evening, another favor, another secret between us.

We talk, laugh, pretend everything is normal. But after a few minutes, a heat stirs low in my belly, coiling deeper with every heartbeat. My skin prickles, growing sensitive and strange, my lips tingling, my thighs pressing together as if on their own. I shift in my seat, uneasy, but the feeling only grows—like a secret, filthy hunger blooming under my skin. My cock—my cock feels... wrong. I palm it through my clothes, just a touch, and a spike of shame ripples up my spine.

But even as anger simmers, I know the truth: I’m wet with want, and no matter how hard I squeeze my thighs, the ache won’t go away.\n\nI try to stand, but I’m dizzy, trembling, every nerve alight with a need I can’t name.

The glass is smooth and warm, the liquid inside thick as syrup, swirling slow. I can still hear the merchant’s voice in my ear: “Just one swallow before you take a girl to bed, and you’ll never go back to being ordinary.”\n\nI hold it up, watch it glint, wonder if it’s all a trick. Maybe it’s nothing but sugar water and a smile. Or maybe—just maybe—it’s real. Maybe tonight, if I drink, I’ll wake up different. Maybe I’ll walk into a room and women will stare, lips parted, cheeks flushed, eyes hungry. Maybe I’ll finally fuck like a man, not a boy, leave someone spent and shaking, not just pretending. Maybe it will change me forever.\n\nBut as I press the cork free, something in my chest tightens. The air smells sweet and smoky. My cock stirs, hopeful and afraid. I know I could just put it away, pretend I never bought it, never wanted more. Or I could drink—give in to curiosity, to hope, to that gnawing, secret hunger that maybe I could become something new.\n\nMy heart pounds. The night is silent, and I stand alone, staring at the golden swirl, the taste of change already blooming on my tongue."

bno_apply_elixir.1002.desc.self.whiteboi: "The vial is cold against my lips, but the liquid is thick and warm, pouring over my tongue in a golden rush. The taste is strange—sweet at first, then smoky and bitter, heat blooming in my chest, sliding slow and heavy all the way down. For a heartbeat, nothing happens. I stand there in the flickering candlelight, waiting for something—anything—to change.\n\nThen it hits me.\n\nA slow, rolling warmth spreads through my belly, up into my chest, curling into every limb. My skin tingles, tightens, every hair standing on end. I gasp, breath sharp, cock twitching and then wilting, a shiver running down my spine. My heart hammers in my throat. My mouth is wet, my lips tingle, my legs weak. It’s not pain, not even pleasure—just need, empty and aching, a hunger I’ve never felt before.\n\nI close my eyes, and behind my eyelids, I see shapes: hands, lips, slick mouths and strong arms, a thousand impossible, shameful ways to be touched, to be taken, to be filled. My chest feels hot, my hips restless, my thoughts a swirl of moans and whispers I can’t chase away.\n\nWhen I open my eyes, the room feels different. Brighter. Sharper. My own body feels strange—softer, needier, almost foreign. My cock is limp, barely even twitching, but my thighs clench tight, desperate for friction. I try to swallow, but my throat is thick, my breath ragged, and all I can taste is that syrupy sweetness, that promise of more.\n\nA tremble runs through me. Is this what it means to change? To want? My skin is flushed, my thoughts filthy, my heart pounding, and all I can do is stand there, dizzy and aching, desperate for something—anything—to fill the sudden, bottomless hunger blooming inside me."

bno_apply_elixir.0002.desc.bbc.whiteboi: "I lean back against the stone archway, arms crossed, letting the firelight play across my chest as he stands a few steps away—trying to look tough, but I see him trembling. The little pale thing keeps sneaking glances at my body, his eyes flicking from my arms, to my jaw, to the thick outline pressing at my trousers. He’s heard all the rumors: what happens to boys who get too close, what I do to them, what I turn them into.\n\nI let him squirm, swirling the vial slow between my fingers so he can’t look away. The golden liquid glows, thick and sinful, promising everything he pretends he doesn’t want. I hold it up and watch his lips part just a little. “You ever see something like this before?” I rumble, low and lazy. “Elixir of the Black Womb. Rare. Expensive. Most boys wouldn’t dare.”\n\nHe tries to laugh, but it comes out thin, shaky. “What’s it do?” His voice cracks on the last word. I grin, slow and wide, letting him feel the heat rolling off me.\n\n“What does it do?” I step forward, close enough to let him smell my skin, see the sweat shining across my neck, the hunger in my eyes. “Drink it, and everything changes. No more pretending you’re a man. No more hiding that hunger in your belly, the ache that keeps you up at night.” I watch his Adam’s apple bob as he swallows. “It’ll make you softer, sweeter. Your cock’ll shrink every week, your body’ll melt for cock, your ass’ll start begging before you even open your mouth. You’ll be desperate for my hands, my cock—nothing else will matter. You’ll beg to be filled.”\n\nHe blushes deep, tries to turn away, but I slide behind him and press the vial into his palm, my hand dwarfing his. “No shame in it,” I murmur, voice hot against his ear. “It’s what you want, isn’t it? To be ruined? To stop pretending, and let someone bigger—someone real—make you into what you were born to be?”\n\nI let my breath stir the hair at his neck, my fingers stroking his trembling wrist. His heartbeat thuds wild under my thumb, and I feel his pulse jump every time I squeeze. “You drink this, and you’ll never have to pretend again. I’ll take care of you, teach you what you’re for. All those girls you tried to fuck and couldn’t satisfy? They’ll laugh and point while you moan for me, begging to be filled, dripping from both ends.” I nudge the vial to his lips, so close I feel his breath hitch.\n\nHe’s sweating now, cock twitching, a wet patch blooming at the front of his trousers. The fire flickers in his eyes, lighting up the shame, the terror, and the need all tangled together.\n\n“It’s your last chance to say no, little boy,” I whisper, pressing the vial firmer. “Or you can drink, give up, and let me break you in right here. Let me watch you become mine, piece by piece, every inch softer, every hole begging for more.”\n\nI grin as he trembles, knowing I’ve already won—that hunger’s just waiting to spill out, and when it does, he’ll belong to me forever."

bno_apply_elixir.1002.desc.bbc.whiteboi: "His hand is so big I can barely move my wrist. I feel the warmth of his skin, the power in his grip, the soft, threatening rumble of his voice curling in my ear. The vial is pressed to my lips, and I try to swallow, try to say no, but the scent is already thick in my head—sweet and smoky, dizzying. His other hand is heavy on my shoulder, pinning me still. The room is spinning. I close my eyes and feel the glass tip, the golden liquid slipping past my lips.\n\nIt’s thick—honeyed and burning. The taste makes my tongue tingle, heat flaring in my chest, then rolling down into my belly. My legs go weak. I can hear him laugh, deep and satisfied, feel his breath against my cheek. I open my eyes and everything feels sharper, colors brighter, shadows deeper, his body impossibly close.\n\nSomething is happening. My skin prickles, every inch more sensitive than before. My cock, stiff a moment ago, goes soft, useless, but I can’t stop shaking. My lips are wet. My ass clenches, desperate and empty. My thoughts twist, melt, reform: what have I done? Did he really make me drink it? Am I going to change—right here, in front of him? Is he going to watch me fall apart?\n\nHe doesn’t let go. His grip is gentle now, fingers sliding through my hair, palm cupping my cheek. I look up and see hunger in his eyes, satisfaction, and something like ownership—like he’s already imagining what I’ll be in a day, a week, a month. I can feel it inside me, heat turning to hunger, hunger turning to shame. I want to tell him to stop, to give me back what I was. But I can’t. My voice is thin, my thighs pressed tight, my breath ragged.\n\nHe leans in, his lips at my ear, voice softer now but still so heavy it makes my knees buckle. “Good boy. Now you wait. Let it work. Let it change you. You’re going to beg for it, soon enough.”\n\nHe’s right. The ache is already blooming, hot and deep and spreading. I know I’ll never be the same. And even as I tremble with shame, my cock limp and my ass aching, I already want more."

bno_apply_elixir.0002.desc.whiteboi.whiteboi: "The stew is going cold, and [recipient.GetFirstName] is already making a mess of the bread, cracking jokes about the old woman’s cooking. The caravan’s still fresh on my mind, the memory of the merchant pushing this little glass vial across the market stall—golden liquid shining, promising “change in a single swallow, makes anyone looser, more fun, better in bed.” It sounded ridiculous, but I’d bought it anyway. Just to see.\n\nHe catches me fidgeting with the vial under the table. “What’s that? Trying to season your soup?” he snickers, elbowing me. I shrug and hold it up between two fingers, giving him a smirk. “Some traveling peddler said it’s a miracle elixir—drink it, and you’ll never have a dull night again.” He scoffs, but I can see the curiosity spark in his eyes as I set it down next to his bowl.\n\n“Go on, then,” he says, all bravado, reaching for it, twisting the bottle in his hand. “You first,” I tease, leaning back. “Bet you won’t do it.” He snorts, shaking his head. “You’d probably just say I was scared.” I say nothing, watching him tap the cork with his thumb, the game stretching between us, silent and sharp.\n\nIt’d be easy to pull it back, to call it off, to let the moment die. But I want to see what happens if he drinks. Is it just a trick? Will he even notice? Or will he change right in front of me, the way that sly merchant hinted, the way I’m almost hoping he will?\n\nHe holds the vial up to the candle, syrupy liquid catching the light. For a second, he hesitates, looking at me, waiting for a sign. All I do is shrug, smirking, keeping my voice cool. “Suit yourself.”\n\nIt’s his choice now—or at least that’s what I tell myself."

bno_apply_elixir.1002.desc.whiteboi.whiteboi: "The glass is still warm from my grip as I set the empty vial down next to my half-eaten stew. [actor.GetFirstName] is watching me, but I try to ignore it—pretend I’m just bored, that this was nothing more than a dare and a mouthful of sweet, smoky nothing. But I can’t keep my eyes from drifting back to the golden shimmer on my lips, the taste thick and heavy in my mouth, clinging like honey even as I try to swallow it away.\n\nAt first it’s just a flush, a low heat that starts behind my navel and seeps up into my chest. I shift in my seat, rubbing my palms on my thighs, but the warmth keeps spreading—curling around my hips, licking along my skin, making every inch of me suddenly, embarrassingly aware. I glance at [actor.GetFirstName] and see him smirking, leaning back, elbows on the table like he’s waiting for a show. My pulse jumps. I want to say something cocky, but my mouth feels too wet, my tongue heavy, and all I can do is look away.\n\nThen it builds—faster than I’m ready for. My cock feels strange: not hard, not soft, just full and twitching, sensitive in a way I’ve never felt before. My balls tighten, my thighs clench, and I can’t help rubbing my knees together, desperate for friction I can’t ask for. It’s not even arousal—it’s something hotter, deeper, like an ache blooming right down to my bones. My nipples prickle against my shirt, every brush of fabric a tease, every breath making me more aware of how empty and raw I feel inside.\n\nThe air around the dinner table is thick, every sound sharp—his spoon clinks against the bowl and it’s like thunder, my own heartbeat roaring in my ears. I can smell stew and sweat, but also something else—something muskier, darker, that makes my mouth water and my stomach twist. My skin feels flushed, oversensitive, and I keep imagining [actor.GetFirstName] watching me, his eyes on my throat, my lips, my fidgeting hands.\n\nIt’d be easy to play it off, to make a joke or shove him, but my tongue feels slow and my mind keeps sliding back to the heat pooling between my legs, the urge to squirm in my seat, to reach under the table and touch myself just to see if it helps. I can’t. I won’t. But the ache only grows, and shame creeps up my neck as I realize I want him to see—I want someone to know what’s happening to me, how good and desperate and ruined I feel already.\n\nI shift again, trying to hide the shiver that runs through me. My whole body is alive, pulsing, hungry for something I can’t name. My cock dribbles, leaking slick against my thigh, but no matter how I squeeze or squirm, nothing helps. The feeling is everywhere, hot and relentless, and all I can do is sit there, biting my lip, helpless as the Elixir’s hunger starts to own me."
