building_bbc_church_01_desc: "Even now, before a single spire pierces the sky or stained glass glows with forbidden hues, I can almost feel it:  the chill thrum of power emanating from that bedrock foundation.

building_type_bbc_trader_01: "Obsidian Caravan"
building_type_bbc_trader_01_desc: "A wandering market consecrated to the Black New World Order. Its wagons carry the Tincture of Genesis, binding sluts to live on cum alone until their skin darkens and their wombs ripen as Black Queens. Alongside it flows the Elixir of the Black Womb, an insidious draught that unmans whitebois, erasing their cocks and reshaping them into fertile sluts with swelling bellies. Stalls display cock cages for pathetic worms, chastity piercings for sluts who surrender their pussies and beg to be bred only through their asses, and countless other tools of submission. The Caravan begins as a passing camp, but with each tier it digs deeper until it becomes a permanent scar of seed and conquest."

building_bbc_trader_01: "Obsidian Clearing"
building_bbc_trader_01_desc: "Only a raw patch of earth at first, staked with black banners and ringed with torches. A few silk tents flap in the wind as Bulls’ wagons pull in, their musk carried on the air. Whispers spread of strange wares — bottles of Tincture that enslave sluts to seed, flasks of Elixir that promise to unman whitebois. Even at this early stage, sluts sneak glances while whitebois avoid the place in shame."

building_bbc_trader_02: "Obsidian Encampment"
building_bbc_trader_02_desc: "The clearing swells into a full camp, rows of pavilions rising as wagons arrive daily. Bulls gather in droves, their presence overwhelming. The Elixir of the Black Womb is poured openly, whitebois lining up to sip and feel their cocks shrivel. Sluts kneel eagerly for the Tincture, their throats trained to live on cum alone. Smoke, musk, and moans fill the air — no longer a curiosity but a dark artery pumping Bulls’ power into your realm."

building_bbc_trader_03: "Obsidian Grounds"
building_bbc_trader_03_desc: "Now fortified with palisades and crowned with banners, the Caravan has become a permanent sanctum of Bulls. Trade, breeding, and ritual blur into one. The Tincture of Genesis is administered in public rites, sluts celebrated as their skin darkens and wombs ascend. The Elixir flows freely, whitebois paraded as they shrink into dripping new sluts. Stalls overflow with cages, piercings, and shackles, every tool of ownership displayed without shame. The land itself is marked forever as a hub of BNWO trade and transformation."
